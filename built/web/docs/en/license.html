      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The Node.js's missing `keep alive` `http.Agent`. Support `http` and `https`.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install agentkeepalive --save
```

## new Agent([options])

* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.
  Can have the following fields:
  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by
    other requests in the future. Default = `true`
  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using HTTP KeepAlive, how often
    to send TCP KeepAlive packets over sockets being kept alive.
    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `keepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout
    after `keepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.
    Default is `15000`.
    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout
    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.
    Default is `keepAliveTimeout * 2`.
  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per
    host. Default = `Infinity`.
  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to leave open
    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
    Default = `256`.

## Usage

```js
var http = require('http');
var Agent = require('agentkeepalive');

var keepaliveAgent = new Agent({
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10,
  timeout: 60000,
  keepAliveTimeout: 30000 // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds
});

var options = {
  host: 'cnodejs.org',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent
};

var req = http.request(options, function (res) {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', function (e) {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('keep alive sockets:');
  console.log(keepaliveAgent.unusedSockets);
}, 2000);

```

### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`

`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:

```js
{
  createSocketCount: 10,
  closeSocketCount: 5,
  timeoutSocketCount: 0,
  requestCount: 5,
  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479::': 3 },
  sockets: { 'localhost:57479::': 5 },
  requests: {}
}
```

### Support `https`

```js
var https = require('https');
var HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;

var keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();
// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=12&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8
var options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/search?q=nodejs&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=12&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent
};

var req = https.request(options, function (res) {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', function (e) {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('keep alive sockets:');
  console.log(keepaliveAgent.unusedSockets);
  process.exit();
}, 2000);
```

&gt; Regular expression for matching [ANSI escape codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save ansi-regex
```


## Usage

```js
var ansiRegex = require('ansi-regex');

ansiRegex().test('\u001b[4mcake\u001b[0m');
//=&gt; true

ansiRegex().test('cake');
//=&gt; false

'\u001b[4mcake\u001b[0m'.match(ansiRegex());
//=&gt; ['\u001b[4m', '\u001b[0m']
```

*It's a function so you can create multiple instances. Regexes with the global flag will have the `.lastIndex` property changed for each call to methods on the instance. Therefore reusing the instance with multiple calls will not work as expected for `.test()`.*

Call an array of asynchronous functions in parallel

### API

#### parallel(fns[, context[, callback]])

```js
var parallel = require('array-parallel')

parallel([
  function (done) {
    done()
  }
], this, function (err) {

})
```

#### fns

`fns` is an array of functions to call in parallel.
The argument signature should be:

```js
function (done) {
  done(new Error())
  // or
  done(null, result)
}
```

That is, each function should only take a `done` as an argument.
Each callback should only take an `Error` as the first argument,
or a value as the second.

#### context

Optional context to pass to each `fn`.
Basically `fn.call(context, done)`.

#### callback(err, results)

```js
function (err, results) {

}
```

Only argument is an `Error` argument.
It will be the first error retrieved from all the `fns`.
`results` will be an array of results from each `fn`,
thus this could be considered an asynchronous version of `[].map`.

ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.

## Example

Define model:

```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');

var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});

var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```

Encode data:

```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```

Decode data:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
console.log(human);
/*
{ firstName: &lt;Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73&gt;,
  lastName: &lt;Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e&gt;,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: &lt;Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64&gt; } ] }
*/
```

### Partial decode

Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date
* assert.regex

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.
* `bower install async-each` if you’re using [Bower](http://bower.io).

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

Node.js:

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});
```

Browser:

```javascript
window.asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

An optionally-asynchronous forEach with an interesting interface.

## Getting Started

This code should work just fine in Node.js:

First, install the module with: `npm install async-foreach`

```javascript
var forEach = require('async-foreach').forEach;
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
});
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
```

Or in the browser:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;dist/ba-foreach.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
});
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
&lt;/script&gt;
```

In the browser, you can attach the forEach method to any object.

```html
&lt;script&gt;
this.exports = Bocoup.utils;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;dist/ba-foreach.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
Bocoup.utils.forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
});
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## The General Idea (Why I thought this was worth sharing)

The idea is to allow the callback to decide _at runtime_ whether the loop will be synchronous or asynchronous. By using `this` in a creative way (in situations where that value isn't already spoken for), an entire control API can be offered without over-complicating function signatures.

```javascript
forEach(arr, function(item, index) {
  // Synchronous.
});

forEach(arr, function(item, index) {
  // Only when `this.async` is called does iteration becomes asynchronous. The
  // loop won't be continued until the `done` function is executed.
  var done = this.async();
  // Continue in one second.
  setTimeout(done, 1000);
});

forEach(arr, function(item, index) {
  // Break out of synchronous iteration early by returning false.
  return index !== 1;
});

forEach(arr, function(item, index) {
  // Break out of asynchronous iteration early...
  var done = this.async();
  // ...by passing false to the done function.
  setTimeout(function() {
    done(index !== 1);
  });
});
```

## Examples
See the unit tests for more examples.

```javascript
// Generic &quot;done&quot; callback.
function allDone(notAborted, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;done&quot;, notAborted, arr);
}

// Synchronous.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done true [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

// Synchronous with early abort.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
  if (item === &quot;b&quot;) { return false; }
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done false [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

// Asynchronous.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
  var done = this.async();
  setTimeout(function() {
    done();
  }, 500);
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done true [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

// Asynchronous with early abort.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
  var done = this.async();
  setTimeout(function() {
    done(item !== &quot;b&quot;);
  }, 500);
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done false [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

// Not actually asynchronous.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
  var done = this.async()
  done();
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each c 2 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done true [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

// Not actually asynchronous with early abort.
forEach([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], function(item, index, arr) {
  console.log(&quot;each&quot;, item, index, arr);
  var done = this.async();
  done(item !== &quot;b&quot;);
}, allDone);
// logs:
// each a 0 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// each b 1 [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
// done false [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

_Also, please don't edit files in the &quot;dist&quot; subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the &quot;lib&quot; subdirectory!_

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Following is a table of the options you can use:

| Option                   | Default              | Description                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ast`                    | `true`               | Include the AST in the returned object |
| `auxiliaryCommentAfter`  | `null`               | Attach a comment after all non-user injected code. |
| `auxiliaryCommentBefore` | `null`               | Attach a comment before all non-user injected code. |
| `babelrc`                | `true`               | Specify whether or not to use .babelrc and .babelignore files. Not available when using the CLI, [use `--no-babelrc` instead](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-ignoring-babelrc). |
| `code`                   | `true`               | Enable code generation |
| `comments`               | `true`               | Output comments in generated output. |
| `compact`                | `&quot;auto&quot;`             | Do not include superfluous whitespace characters and line terminators. When set to `&quot;auto&quot;` compact is set to `true` on input sizes of &gt;500KB. |
| `env`                    | `{}`                 | This is an object of keys that represent different environments. For example, you may have: `{ env: { production: { /* specific options */ } } }` which will use those options when the environment variable `BABEL_ENV` is set to `&quot;production&quot;`. If `BABEL_ENV` isn't set then `NODE_ENV` will be used, if it's not set then it defaults to `&quot;development&quot;` |
| `extends`                | `null`               | A path to an `.babelrc` file to extend |
| `filename`               | `&quot;unknown&quot;`          | Filename for use in errors etc. |
| `filenameRelative`       | `(filename)`         | Filename relative to `sourceRoot`. |
| `generatorOpts`          | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel code generator, babel-generator |
| `getModuleId`            | `null`               | Specify a custom callback to generate a module id with. Called as `getModuleId(moduleName)`. If falsy value is returned then the generated module id is used. |
| `highlightCode`          | `true`               | ANSI highlight syntax error code frames |
| `ignore`                 | `null`               | Opposite to the `only` option. `ignore` is disregarded if `only` is specified. |
| `inputSourceMap`         | `null`               | A source map object that the output source map will be based on. |
| `minified`               | `false`              | Should the output be minified (not printing last semicolons in blocks, printing literal string values instead of escaped ones, stripping `()` from `new` when safe) |
| `moduleId`               | `null`               | Specify a custom name for module ids. |
| `moduleIds`              | `false`              | If truthy, insert an explicit id for modules. By default, all modules are anonymous. (Not available for `common` modules) |
| `moduleRoot`             | `(sourceRoot)`       | Optional prefix for the AMD module formatter that will be prepend to the filename on module definitions. |
| `only`                   | `null`               | A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), regex, or mixed array of both, matching paths to **only** compile. Can also be an array of arrays containing paths to explicitly match. When attempting to compile a non-matching file it's returned verbatim. |
| `parserOpts`             | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel parser, babylon |
| `plugins`                | `[]`                 | List of [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/) to load and use. |
| `presets`                | `[]`                 | List of [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets) (a set of plugins) to load and use. |
| `retainLines`            | `false`              | Retain line numbers. This will lead to wacky code but is handy for scenarios where you can't use source maps. (**NOTE:** This will not retain the columns) |
| `resolveModuleSource`    | `null`               | Resolve a module source ie. `import &quot;SOURCE&quot;;` to a custom value. Called as `resolveModuleSource(source, filename)`. |
| `shouldPrintComment`     | `null`               | An optional callback that controls whether a comment should be output or not. Called as `shouldPrintComment(commentContents)`. **NOTE:** This overrides the `comment` option when used. |
| `sourceFileName`         | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `sources[0]` on returned source map. |
| `sourceMaps`             | `false`              | If truthy, adds a `map` property to returned output. If set to `&quot;inline&quot;`, a comment with a sourceMappingURL directive is added to the bottom of the returned code. If set to `&quot;both&quot;` then a `map` property is returned as well as a source map comment appended. **This does not emit sourcemap files by itself!** To have sourcemaps emitted using the CLI, you must pass it the `--source-maps` option. |
| `sourceMapTarget`        | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `file` on returned source map. |
| `sourceRoot`             | `(moduleRoot)`       | The root from which all sources are relative. |
| `sourceType`             | `&quot;module&quot;`           | Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either &quot;script&quot; or &quot;module&quot;. |
| `wrapPluginVisitorMethod`| `null`               | An optional callback that can be used to wrap visitor methods. **NOTE:** This is useful for things like introspection, and not really needed for implementing anything. Called as `wrapPluginVisitorMethod(pluginAlias, visitorType, callback)`.</pre></section></details><details><summary>babel-generator@6.26.1</summary><section><h3>babel-generator@6.26.1</h3><pre># babel-generator

&gt; Turns an AST into code.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-generator
```

## Usage

```js
import {parse} from 'babylon';
import generate from 'babel-generator';

const code = 'class Example {}';
const ast = parse(code);

const output = generate(ast, { /* options */ }, code);
```

## Options

Options for formatting output:

name                   | type     | default         | description
-----------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
auxiliaryCommentBefore | string   |                 | Optional string to add as a block comment at the start of the output file
auxiliaryCommentAfter  | string   |                 | Optional string to add as a block comment at the end of the output file
shouldPrintComment     | function | `opts.comments` | Function that takes a comment (as a string) and returns `true` if the comment should be included in the output.  By default, comments are included if `opts.comments` is `true` or if `opts.minifed` is `false` and the comment contains `@preserve` or `@license`
retainLines            | boolean  | `false`         | Attempt to use the same line numbers in the output code as in the source code (helps preserve stack traces)
retainFunctionParens   | boolean  | `false`         | Retain parens around function expressions (could be used to change engine parsing behavior)
comments               | boolean  | `true`          | Should comments be included in output
compact                | boolean or `'auto'` | `opts.minified` | Set to `true` to avoid adding whitespace for formatting
minified               | boolean  | `false`         | Should the output be minified
concise                | boolean  | `false`         | Set to `true` to reduce whitespace (but not as much as `opts.compact`)
quotes                 | `'single'` or `'double'` | autodetect based on `ast.tokens` | The type of quote to use in the output
filename               | string   |                 | Used in warning messages
flowCommaSeparator     | boolean  | `false`         | Set to `true` to use commas instead of semicolons as Flow property separators
jsonCompatibleStrings  | boolean  | `false`         | Set to true to run `jsesc` with &quot;json&quot;: true to print &quot;\u00A9&quot; vs. &quot;©&quot;;

Options for source maps:

name                   | type     | default         | description
-----------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
sourceMaps             | boolean  | `false`         | Enable generating source maps
sourceMapTarget        | string   |                 | The filename of the generated code that the source map will be associated with
sourceRoot             | string   |                 | A root for all relative URLs in the source map
sourceFileName         | string   |                 | The filename for the source code (i.e. the code in the `code` argument).  This will only be used if `code` is a string.

## AST from Multiple Sources

In most cases, Babel does a 1:1 transformation of input-file to output-file.  However,
you may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.
If this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need
to pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys
should be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```js
import {parse} from 'babylon';
import generate from 'babel-generator';

const a = 'var a = 1;';
const b = 'var b = 2;';
const astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });
const astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });
const ast = {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)
};

const { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {
  'a.js': a,
  'b.js': b
});

// Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.

) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar'
);
```

If you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
- param2
+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma
+ param3  // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
- 'bar'
+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma
+ 'baz'  // Add param3
);
```
In total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.

If you had your function defined with trailing commas:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
Adding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
+ param3, // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
+ 'baz', // Add param3
);
```
In the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.

&gt; Proposal Withdrawn: can be solved with decorators.

This plugin allows Babel to transform class constructors.

It basically allows to use the [new.target](http://mdn.io/new.target) feature on ES2015 classes:

```js
class Point {

  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  call constructor(x, y) {
    return new Point(x, y);
  }

}

let p1 = new Point(1, 2); // OK
let p2 = Point(3, 4); // OK
```

## Example

### Date example
The javascript [Date](http://mdn.io/date) works this way:

```js
// You can get a Date instance using the new keyword
let now = new Date();
console.log(now.getMonth()); // Prints '3'
console.log(now.toString()); // Prints 'Mon Apr 11 2016 13:26:07 GMT+0100 (BST)'

// You can get a string of the current date using Date as a function:
let nowStr = Date();
console.log(nowStr); // Prints 'Mon Apr 11 2016 13:26:07 GMT+0100 (BST)'
```

It is currently possible to implement something like that using [new.target](http://mdn.io/new.target) (see [example in proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/workingdocs/callconstructor.md#motivating-example)) and this new feature makes it available for ES2015 classes.

A date implementation could be:

```js
class Date {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  call constructor() {
    let date = new Date();
    return date.toString();
  }
}

let now = new Date(); // Get a Date instance
let nowStr = Date(); // Use the 'call constructor()' part to get a string value of the current date
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-class-constructor-call
```

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-class-constructor-call&quot;]
}

&gt; This plugin transforms es2015 static class properties as well as properties declared with the es2016 property initializer syntax.

## Example

Below is a class with four class properties which will be transformed.

```js
  class Bork {
    //Property initializer syntax
    instanceProperty = &quot;bork&quot;;
    boundFunction = () =&gt; {
      return this.instanceProperty;
    }

    //Static class properties
    static staticProperty = &quot;babelIsCool&quot;;
    static staticFunction = function() {
      return Bork.staticProperty;
    }
  }

  let myBork = new Bork;

  //Property initializers are not on the prototype.
  console.log(myBork.prototype.boundFunction); // &gt; undefined

  //Bound functions are bound to the class instance.
  console.log(myBork.boundFunction.call(undefined)); // &gt; &quot;bork&quot;

  //Static function exists on the class.
  console.log(Bork.staticFunction()); // &gt; &quot;babelIsCool&quot;
```


## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-class-properties
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
// without options
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-class-properties&quot;]
}

// with options
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    [&quot;transform-class-properties&quot;, { &quot;spec&quot;: true }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh

```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-core&quot;).transform(&quot;code&quot;, {
  plugins: [&quot;transform-class-properties&quot;]
});
```

## Options

### `spec`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Class properties are compiled to use `Object.defineProperty`. Static fields are now defined even if they are not initialized.

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

Without options:

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-es2015-block-scoping&quot;]
}
```

With options:

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [

### Via Node API

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-core&quot;).transform(&quot;code&quot;, {
  plugins: [&quot;transform-es2015-block-scoping&quot;]
});
```

## Options `throwIfClosureRequired`

In cases such as the following it's impossible to rewrite let/const without adding an additional function and closure while transforming:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1);
}
```

In extremely performance-sensitive code, this can be undesirable. If `&quot;throwIfClosureRequired&quot;: true` is set, Babel throws when transforming these patterns instead of automatically adding an additional function.</pre></section></details><details><summary>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes@6.24.1</summary><section><h3>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes@6.24.1</h3><pre># babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes

&gt; Compile ES2015 classes to ES5

## Caveats

Built-in classes such as `Date`, `Array`, `DOM` etc cannot be properly subclassed
due to limitations in ES5 (for the [es2015-classes](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-classes) plugin).
You can try to use [babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend) based on `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Reflect.construct`, but it also has some limitations.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js

    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-classes script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-core&quot;).transform(&quot;code&quot;, {
  plugins: [&quot;transform-es2015-classes&quot;]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

#### Method enumerability

Please note that in loose mode class methods **are** enumerable. This is not in line
with the spec and you may run into issues.

#### Method assignment

Under loose mode, methods are defined on the class prototype with simple assignments
instead of being defined. This can result in the following not working:

```javascript
class Foo {
  set bar() {
    throw new Error(&quot;foo!&quot;);
  }
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  bar() {
    // will throw an error when this method is defined
  }
}
```

When `Bar.prototype.foo` is defined it triggers the setter on `Foo`. This is a
case that is very unlikely to appear in production code however it's something
to keep in mind.</pre></section></details><details><summary>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties@6.24.1</summary><section><h3>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties@6.24.1</h3><pre># babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties

This plugin actually converts duplicate keys in objects to be computed properties, which then must be handled by the [transform-es2015-computed-properties](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-computed-properties) plugin. The final result won't contain any object literals with duplicate keys.

```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

In loose mode, arrays are put in a fast path, thus heavily increasing performance.
All other iterables will continue to work fine.

#### Example

**In**

```js
for (var i of foo) {}
```

**Out**

```js
for (var _iterator = foo, _isArray = Array.isArray(_iterator), _i = 0, _iterator = _isArray ? _iterator : _iterator[Symbol.iterator]();;) {
  var _ref;

  if (_isArray) {
    if (_i &gt;= _iterator.length) break;
    _ref = _iterator[_i++];
  } else {
    _i = _iterator.next();
    if (_i.done) break;
    _ref = _i.value;
  }

  var i = _ref;
}
```

#### Abrupt completions

In loose mode an iterator's `return` method will not be called on abrupt completions caused by thrown errors.

Please see [google/traceur-compiler#1773](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/1773) and
[babel/babel#838](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/838) for more information.

### Optimization

If a basic array is used, Babel will compile the for-of loop down to a regular for loop.

**In**

```js
for (let a of [1,2,3]) {}
```

**Out**

```js
var _arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (var _i = 0; _i &lt; _arr.length; _i++) {
  var a = _arr[_i];
}

});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

As per the spec, `import` and `export` are only allowed to be used at the top
level. When in loose mode these are allowed to be used anywhere.

And by default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;

Object.defineProperty(exports, &quot;__esModule&quot;, {
  value: true
});
```

In environments that don't support this you can enable loose mode on `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs`
and instead of using `Object.defineProperty` an assignment will be used instead.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;
exports.__esModule = true;
```

### `strict`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

By default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported. In some cases this property is used to determine if the import _is_ the
default export or if it _contains_ the default export.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;

Object.defineProperty(exports, &quot;__esModule&quot;, {
  value: true
});
```

In order to prevent the `__esModule` property from being exported, you can set
the `strict` option to `true`.

### `noInterop`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

By default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported. This property is then used to determine if the import _is_ the default
export or if it _contains_ the default export.

```javascript
&quot;use strict&quot;;

var _foo = require(&quot;foo&quot;);

var _foo2 = _interopRequireDefault(_foo);

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) {
  return obj &amp;&amp; obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };
}
```

In cases where the auto-unwrapping of `default` is not needed, you can set the
`noInterop` option to `true` to avoid the usage of the `interopRequireDefault`
helper (shown in inline form above).</pre></section></details><details><summary>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-systemjs@6.24.1</summary><section><h3>babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-systemjs@6.24.1</h3><pre># babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-systemjs

&gt; This plugin transforms ES2015 modules to [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd).

## Example

**In**

```javascript
export default 42;
```

**Out**

```javascript
(function (global, factory) {
  if (typeof define === &quot;function&quot; &amp;&amp; define.amd) {

      exports: {}
    };
    factory(mod.exports);
    global.actual = mod.exports;
  }
})(this, function (exports) {
  &quot;use strict&quot;;

  Object.defineProperty(exports, &quot;__esModule&quot;, {
    value: true
  });

  exports.default = 42;
});
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-umd
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-es2015-modules-umd&quot;]
}
```

You can also override the names of particular libraries when this module is
running in the browser.  For example the `es6-promise` library exposes itself
as `global.Promise` rather than `global.es6Promise`. This can be accommodated by:

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    [&quot;transform-es2015-modules-umd&quot;, {
      &quot;globals&quot;: {
        &quot;es6-promise&quot;: &quot;Promise&quot;
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

#### Default semantics

There are a few things to note about the default semantics.

_First_, this transform uses the
[basename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename) of each import to generate
the global names in the UMD output. This means that if you're importing
multiple modules with the same basename, like:

```js
import fooBar1 from &quot;foo-bar&quot;;
import fooBar2 from &quot;./mylib/foo-bar&quot;;
```

it will transpile into two references to the same browser global:

```js
factory(global.fooBar, global.fooBar);
```

If you set the plugin options to:

```json
{
  &quot;globals&quot;: {
    &quot;foo-bar&quot;: &quot;fooBAR&quot;,
    &quot;./mylib/foo-bar&quot;: &quot;mylib.fooBar&quot;
  }
}
```

it will still transpile both to one browser global:

```js
factory(global.fooBAR, global.fooBAR);
```

because again the transform is only using the basename of the import.

_Second_, the specified override will still be passed to the `toIdentifier`
function in [babel-types/src/converters](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-types/src/converters.js).
This means that if you specify an override as a member expression like:

```json
{
  &quot;globals&quot;: {
    &quot;fizzbuzz&quot;: &quot;fizz.buzz&quot;
  }
}
```

this will _not_ transpile to `factory(global.fizz.buzz)`. Instead, it will
transpile to `factory(global.fizzBuzz)` based on the logic in `toIdentifier`.

_Third_, you cannot override the exported global name.

#### More flexible semantics with `exactGlobals: true`

All of these behaviors can limit the flexibility of the `globals` map. To
remove these limitations, you can set the `exactGlobals` option to `true`.
Doing this instructs the plugin to:

1. always use the full import string instead of the basename when generating
the global names
2. skip passing `globals` overrides to the `toIdentifier` function. Instead,
they are used exactly as written, so you will get errors if you do not use
valid identifiers or valid uncomputed (dot) member expressions.
3. allow the exported global name to be overridden via the `globals` map. Any
override must again be a valid identifier or valid member expression.

Thus, if you set `exactGlobals` to `true` and do not pass any overrides, the
first example of:

```js
import fooBar1 from &quot;foo-bar&quot;;
import fooBar2 from &quot;./mylib/foo-bar&quot;;
```

will transpile to:

```js
factory(global.fooBar, global.mylibFooBar);
```

And if you set the plugin options to:

```json
{
  &quot;globals&quot;: {
    &quot;foo-bar&quot;: &quot;fooBAR&quot;,
    &quot;./mylib/foo-bar&quot;: &quot;mylib.fooBar&quot;
  },
  &quot;exactGlobals&quot;: true
}
```

then it'll transpile to:

```js
factory(global.fooBAR, global.mylib.fooBar)
```

Finally, with the plugin options set to:

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    &quot;external-helpers&quot;,
    [&quot;transform-es2015-modules-umd&quot;, {
      &quot;globals&quot;: {
        &quot;my/custom/module/name&quot;: &quot;My.Custom.Module.Name&quot;
      },
      &quot;exactGlobals&quot;: true
    }]
  ],
  &quot;moduleId&quot;: &quot;my/custom/module/name&quot;
}
```

it will transpile to:

```js
factory(mod.exports);
global.My = global.My || {};
global.My.Custom = global.My.Custom || {};
global.My.Custom.Module = global.My.Custom.Module || {};
global.My.Custom.Module.Name = mod.exports;
```

```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js
// without options
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-es2015-template-literals&quot;]
}

// with options
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    [&quot;transform-es2015-template-literals&quot;, {
      &quot;loose&quot;: true,
      &quot;spec&quot;: true
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-template-literals script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-core&quot;).transform(&quot;code&quot;, {
  plugins: [&quot;transform-es2015-template-literals&quot;]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`
In loose mode, tagged template literal objects aren't frozen.


### `spec`
This option wraps all template literal expressions with `String`. See [babel/babel#1065](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1065) for more info.

**In**

```javascript
`foo${bar}`;
```

**Out**

```javascript
&quot;foo&quot; + String(bar);

&gt; ES6 introduces a new native type called [symbols](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-symbols). This transformer wraps all `typeof` expressions with a method that replicates native behaviour. (ie. returning &quot;symbol&quot; for symbols)

## Example

**In**

```javascript
typeof Symbol() === &quot;symbol&quot;;
```

**Out**

```javascript
var _typeof = function (obj) {
  return obj &amp;&amp; obj.constructor === Symbol ? &quot;symbol&quot; : typeof obj;
};

_typeof(Symbol()) === &quot;symbol&quot;;

&gt; This plugin allows Babel to transform rest properties for object destructuring assignment and spread properties for object literals.

## Example

### Rest Properties

```js
let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
console.log(x); // 1
console.log(y); // 2
console.log(z); // { a: 3, b: 4 }
```

### Spread Properties

```js
let n = { x, y, ...z };
console.log(n); // { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 }
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;transform-object-rest-spread&quot;]

```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-core&quot;).transform(&quot;code&quot;, {
  plugins: [&quot;transform-object-rest-spread&quot;]
});
```

## Options

### `useBuiltIns`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

By default, this plugin uses Babel's `extends` helper which polyfills `Object.assign`. Enabling this option will use `Object.assign` directly.

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    [&quot;transform-object-rest-spread&quot;, { &quot;useBuiltIns&quot;: true }]
  ]
}
```

**In**

```js
z = { x, ...y };
```

**Out**

```js
z = Object.assign({ x }, y);
```

&gt; Babel preset for stage 1 plugins.

The gist of Stage 1 is:

&gt; **Stage 1**: proposal
&gt;
&gt; **What is it?** A formal proposal for the feature.
&gt;
&gt; **What’s required?** A so-called champion must be identified who is responsible for the proposal. Either the champion or a co-champion must be a member of TC39 (source). The problem solved by the proposal must be described in prose. The solution must be described via examples, an API and a discussion of semantics and algorithms. Lastly, potential obstacles for the proposal must be identified, such as interactions with other features and implementation challenges. Implementation-wise, polyfills and demos are needed.
&gt;
&gt; **What’s next?** By accepting a proposal for stage 1, TC39 declares its willingness to examine, discuss and contribute to the proposal. Going forward, major changes to the proposal are expected

&gt; Babel preset for stage 2 plugins.

The gist of Stage 2 is:

&gt; **Stage 2:** draft
&gt; 
&gt; **What is it?** A first version of what will be in the specification. At this point, an eventual inclusion of the feature in the standard is likely.
&gt; 
&gt; **What’s required?** The proposal must now additionally have a formal description of the syntax and semantics of the feature (using the formal language of the ECMAScript specification). The description should be as complete as possible, but can contain todos and placeholders. Two experimental implementations of the feature are needed, but one of them can be in a transpiler such as Babel.
&gt;
&gt; **What’s next?** Only incremental changes are expected from now on.

The gist of Stage 3 is:

&gt; **Stage 3**: candidate
&gt;
&gt; **What is it?** The proposal is mostly finished and now needs feedback from implementations and users to progress further.

&gt; **What’s required?** The spec text must be complete. Designated reviewers (appointed by TC39, not by the champion) and the ECMAScript spec editor must sign off on the spec text. There must be at least two spec-compliant implementations (which don’t have to be enabled by default).
&gt;
&gt; **What’s next?** Henceforth, changes should only be made in response to critical issues raised by the implementations and their use.

&gt; The require hook will bind itself to node's require and automatically compile files on the fly.

One of the ways you can use Babel is through the require hook. The require hook
will bind itself to node's `require` and automatically compile files on the
fly. This is equivalent to CoffeeScript's
[coffee-script/register](http://coffeescript.org/v2/annotated-source/register.html).

## Install

```sh
npm install babel-register --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
require(&quot;babel-register&quot;);
```

All subsequent files required by node with the extensions `.es6`, `.es`, `.jsx`
and `.js` will be transformed by Babel.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;babel-callout babel-callout-info&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Polyfill not included&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You must include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/&quot;&gt;polyfill&lt;/a&gt; separately
    when using features that require it, like generators.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

### Ignores `node_modules` by default

**NOTE:** By default all requires to `node_modules` will be ignored. You can
override this by passing an ignore regex via:

```js
require(&quot;babel-register&quot;)({
  // This will override `node_modules` ignoring - you can alternatively pass
  // an array of strings to be explicitly matched or a regex / glob
  ignore: false
});
```

## Specifying options

```javascript
require(&quot;babel-register&quot;)({
  // Optional ignore regex - if any filenames **do** match this regex then they
  // aren't compiled.
  ignore: /regex/,

  // Ignore can also be specified as a function.
  ignore: function(filename) {
    if (filename === &quot;/path/to/es6-file.js&quot;) {
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  },

  // Optional only regex - if any filenames **don't** match this regex then they
  // aren't compiled
  only: /my_es6_folder/,

  // Setting this will remove the currently hooked extensions of .es6, `.es`, `.jsx`
  // and .js so you'll have to add them back if you want them to be used again.
  extensions: [&quot;.es6&quot;, &quot;.es&quot;, &quot;.jsx&quot;, &quot;.js&quot;],

  // Setting this to false will disable the cache.
  cache: true
});
```

You can pass in all other [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options) as well,
including `plugins` and `presets`. But note that the closest [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)
to each file still applies, and takes precedence over any options you pass in here.

## Environment variables

By default `babel-node` and `babel-register` will save to a json cache in your
temporary directory.

This will heavily improve with the startup and compilation of your files. There
are however scenarios where you want to change this behaviour and there are
environment variables exposed to allow you to do this.

### BABEL_CACHE_PATH

Specify a different cache location.

```sh
BABEL_CACHE_PATH=/foo/my-cache.json babel-node script.js
```

### BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE

Disable the cache.

```sh
BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node script.js

&gt; Generate an AST from a string template.

In computer science, this is known as an implementation of quasiquotes.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-template
```

## Usage

```js
import template from &quot;babel-template&quot;;
import generate from &quot;babel-generator&quot;;
import * as t from &quot;babel-types&quot;;

const buildRequire = template(`
  var IMPORT_NAME = require(SOURCE);

  SOURCE: t.stringLiteral(&quot;my-module&quot;)
});

console.log(generate(ast).code);
```

```js
const myModule = require(&quot;my-module&quot;);
```

## API

### `template(code, [opts])`

#### code

Type: `string`

#### options

`babel-template` accepts all of the options from [babylon], and specifies
some defaults of its own:

* `allowReturnOutsideFunction` is set to `true` by default.
* `allowSuperOutsideMethod` is set to `true` by default.

##### preserveComments

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to preserve any comments from the `code` parameter.

#### Return value

`babel-template` returns a `function` which is invoked with an optional object
of replacements. See the usage section for an example.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32):

&gt; Base32 is a base 32 transfer encoding using the twenty-six letters A–Z and six digits 2–7. It is primarily used to encode binary data, but is able to encode binary text like ASCII.
&gt;
&gt; Base32 has number of advantages over Base64:
&gt;
&gt; 1. The resulting character set is all one case (usually represented as uppercase), which can often be beneficial when using a case-insensitive filesystem, spoken language, or human memory.
&gt;
&gt; 2. The result can be used as file name because it can not possibly contain '/' symbol which is usually acts as path separator in Unix-based operating systems.
&gt;
&gt; 3. The alphabet was selected to avoid similar-looking pairs of different symbols, so the strings can be accurately transcribed by hand. (For example, the symbol set omits the symbols for 1, 8 and zero, since they could be confused with the letters 'I', 'B', and 'O'.)
&gt;
&gt; 4. A result without padding can be included in a URL without encoding any characters.
&gt;
&gt; However, Base32 representation takes roughly 20% more space than Base64.

## Documentation

Full documentation at http://mikepb.github.io/base32.js/

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install base32.js
```

## Usage

Encoding an array of bytes using [Crockford][crock32], appending a CRC-8
checksum:

```js
var base32 = require(&quot;base32.js&quot;);

var buf = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var encoder = new base32.Encoder({ type: &quot;crockford&quot;, lc: true });
var str = encoder.write(buf).finalize();
// str = &quot;04106173&quot;

var decoder = new base32.Decoder({ type: &quot;crockford&quot; });
var out = decoder.write(str).finalize();
// out = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The default Base32 variant if no `type` is provided is `&quot;rfc4648&quot;` without
padding.

# Browser support

The browser versions of the library may be found under the `dist/` directory.
The browser files are updated on each versioned release, but not for
development. [Karma][karma] is used to run the [mocha][] tests in the browser.

```sh
$ npm install -g karma-cli
$ npm run karma
```

Converting to, and from, [base64url](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#RFC_4648)

# Install

```bash
$ npm install base64url
```

After installing with `npm` you can require this library from JavaScript or TypeScript:

JavaScript
```js
const base64url = require('base64url');
```

TypeScript:
```typescript
import base64url from &quot;base64url&quot;;
```

# Usage

## CLI

The CLI has been removed. For the time being, please install `base64url@1.0.6` if you need the CLI.

## Library

### base64url(input: string | Buffer, encoding: string = &quot;utf8&quot;): string

### base64url.encode(input: string | Buffer, encoding: string = &quot;utf8&quot;): string

base64url encode `input`. Input should be a `string` or a `Buffer`.


Example

```js
&gt; base64url(&quot;ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space&quot;)
'bGFkaWVzIGFuZCBnZW50bGVtYW4sIHdlIGFyZSBmbG9hdGluZyBpbiBzcGFjZQ'
```

---

### base64url.decode(input: string, encoding: string = &quot;utf8&quot;): string

Convert a base64url encoded string into a raw string. The `encoding` argument can be used if the input is a string that's not utf8.

```js
&gt; base64url.decode(&quot;cmlkZTogZHJlYW1zIGJ1cm4gZG93bg&quot;)
'ride: dreams burn down'
```

---

### base64url.fromBase64(input: string): string

Convert a base64 encoded string to a base64url encoded string.

Example

```js
&gt; base64url.fromBase64('qL8R4QIcQ/ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN/MksRtDaErMA==')
'qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA'
```

---


### base64url.toBase64(input: string): string

Convert a base64url encoded string to a base64 encoded string.

```js
&gt; base64url.toBase64('qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA')
'qL8R4QIcQ/ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN/MksRtDaErMA=='
```

---


### base64url.toBuffer(input: string): Buffer

Convert a base64url encoded string to a Buffer containing the decoded bytes.

```js
&gt; base64url.toBuffer('c3Bpcml0dWFsaXplZA')
&lt;Buffer 73 70 69 72 69 74 75 61 6c 69 7a 65 64&gt;
```

&gt; BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.</pre></section></details><details><summary>boom@2.10.1</summary><section><h3>boom@2.10.1</h3><pre>Copyright (c) 2012-2014, Walmart and other contributors.

iono. cuz hakz.

### hau?

```js
var BrowserStdout = require('browser-stdout')

myStream.pipe(BrowserStdout())
```

### monkey

You can monkey-patch `process.stdout` for your dependency graph like this:

```
process.stdout = require('browser-stdout')()
var coolTool = require('module-that-uses-stdout-somewhere-in-its-depths')
```

### opts

opts are passed directly to `stream.Writable`.
additionally, a label arg can be used to label console output.

```js
BrowserStdout({
  objectMode: true,
  label: 'dataz',
})
```

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.from`, uses native implementation if available.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-from
```

## Usage

```js
const bufferFrom = require('buffer-from')

console.log(bufferFrom([1, 2, 3, 4]))
//=&gt; &lt;Buffer 01 02 03 04&gt;

const arr = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
console.log(bufferFrom(arr.buffer, 1, 2))
//=&gt; &lt;Buffer 02 03&gt;

console.log(bufferFrom('test', 'utf8'))
//=&gt; &lt;Buffer 74 65 73 74&gt;

const buf = bufferFrom('test')
console.log(bufferFrom(buf))
//=&gt; &lt;Buffer 74 65 73 74&gt;
```

## API

### bufferFrom(array)

- `array` &amp;lt;Array&amp;gt;

Allocates a new `Buffer` using an `array` of octets.

### bufferFrom(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])

- `arrayBuffer` &amp;lt;ArrayBuffer&amp;gt; The `.buffer` property of a TypedArray or ArrayBuffer
- `byteOffset` &amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; Where to start copying from `arrayBuffer`. **Default:** `0`
- `length` &amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; How many bytes to copy from `arrayBuffer`. **Default:** `arrayBuffer.length - byteOffset`

When passed a reference to the `.buffer` property of a TypedArray instance, the
newly created `Buffer` will share the same allocated memory as the TypedArray.

The optional `byteOffset` and `length` arguments specify a memory range within
the `arrayBuffer` that will be shared by the `Buffer`.

### bufferFrom(buffer)

- `buffer` &amp;lt;Buffer&amp;gt; An existing `Buffer` to copy data from

Copies the passed `buffer` data onto a new `Buffer` instance.

### bufferFrom(string[, encoding])

- `string` &amp;lt;String&amp;gt; A string to encode.
- `encoding` &amp;lt;String&amp;gt; The encoding of `string`. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Creates a new `Buffer` containing the given JavaScript string `string`. If
provided, the `encoding` parameter identifies the character encoding of
`string`.

&gt; Get the path of the caller module

You can't use [`module.parent`](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_parent) as modules are cached and it will return the first caller module, not necessarily the current one.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save caller-path
```


## Usage

```js
// foo.js
var callerPath = require('caller-path');

module.exports = function () {
	console.log(callerPath());
	//=&gt; /Users/sindresorhus/dev/unicorn/bar.js
}
```

```js
// bar.js
var foo = require('./foo');
foo();
```

&gt; Get callsites from the [V8 stack trace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save callsites
```


## Usage

```js
var callsites = require('callsites');

function unicorn() {
	console.log(callsites()[0].getFileName());
	//=&gt; /Users/sindresorhus/dev/callsites/test.js
}

unicorn();
```

## API

Returns an array of callsite objects with the following methods:

- `getThis`: returns the value of this
- `getTypeName`: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.
- `getFunction`: returns the current function
- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.
- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function
- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script
- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number
- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number
- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called
- `isToplevel`: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?
- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?
- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?
- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?

Creative Commons Corporation (&quot;Creative Commons&quot;) is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis. Creative Commons gives no

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

&gt; Terminal string styling done right

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk)

[colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) is currently the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending String.prototype which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68). Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.

**Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**

![screenshot](screenshot.png)


## Why

- **Doesn't extend String.prototype**
- Expressive API
- Clean and focused
- Auto-detects color support
- Actively maintained
- [Used by 150+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)


## Install

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/chalk): `npm install --save chalk`


## Example

Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');

// style a string
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );

// combine styled and normal strings
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );

// compose multiple styles using the chainable API
console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );

// nest styles
console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );

// pass in multiple arguments
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  );
```

You can easily define your own themes.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');
var error = chalk.bold.red;
console.log(error('Error!'));
```


## API

### chalk.`&lt;style&gt;[.&lt;style&gt;...](string, [string...])`

Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`

Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.

Multiple arguments will be separated by space.

### chalk.enabled

Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.

### chalk.supportsColor

Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-color).

Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.

Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.

### chalk.styles

Exposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).

Generally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.styles.red);
//=&gt; {open: '\x1b[31m', close: '\x1b[39m'}

console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close);
```

### chalk.stripColor(string)

[Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.

Can be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.

Example:

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');
var styledString = fromExternal();

if (!chalk.supportsColor) {
	chalk.stripColor(styledString);
}
```


## Styles

### General

- reset
- bold
- italic
- underline
- inverse
- strikethrough

### Text colors

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white

### Background colors

- bgBlack
- bgRed
- bgGreen
- bgYellow

&gt; Terminal string styling done right

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk)
![](http://img.shields.io/badge/unicorn-approved-ff69b4.svg)

[colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) is currently the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending String.prototype which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68). Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.

**Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**

![screenshot](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles/raw/master/screenshot.png)


## Why

- Highly performant
- Doesn't extend String.prototype
- Expressive API
- Ability to nest styles
- Clean and focused
- Auto-detects color support
- Actively maintained
- [Used by 1000+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save chalk
```


## Usage

Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');

// style a string
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );

// combine styled and normal strings
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );

// compose multiple styles using the chainable API
console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );

// pass in multiple arguments
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  );

// nest styles
console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );

// nest styles of the same type even (color, underline, background)
console.log(  chalk.green('I am a green line ' + chalk.blue('with a blue substring') + ' that becomes green again!')  );
```

Easily define your own themes.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');
var error = chalk.bold.red;
console.log(error('Error!'));
```

Take advantage of console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data).

```js
var name = 'Sindre';
console.log(chalk.green('Hello %s'), name);
//=&gt; Hello Sindre
```


## API

### chalk.`&lt;style&gt;[.&lt;style&gt;...](string, [string...])`

Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`

Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.

Multiple arguments will be separated by space.

### chalk.enabled

Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.

### chalk.supportsColor

Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/supports-color).

Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.

Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.

### chalk.styles

Exposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).

Generally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.styles.red);
//=&gt; {open: '\u001b[31m', close: '\u001b[39m'}

console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close);
```

### chalk.hasColor(string)

Check whether a string [has color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-ansi).

### chalk.stripColor(string)

[Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.

Can be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.

Example:

```js
var chalk = require('chalk');
var styledString = getText();

if (!chalk.supportsColor) {
	styledString = chalk.stripColor(styledString);
}
```


## Styles

### General

- `reset`
- `bold`
- `dim`
- `italic` *(not widely supported)*
- `underline`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethrough` *(not widely supported)*

### Text colors

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `gray`

### Background colors

- `bgBlack`
- `bgRed`
- `bgGreen`
- `bgYellow`
- `bgBlue`
- `bgMagenta`
- `bgCyan`

$('h2.title').text('Hello there!')
$('h2').addClass('welcome')

$.html()
//=&gt; &lt;h2 class=&quot;title welcome&quot;&gt;Hello there!&lt;/h2&gt;
```

## Installation
`npm install cheerio`

## Features
__&amp;#10084; Familiar syntax:__
Cheerio implements a subset of core jQuery. Cheerio removes all the DOM inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jQuery library, revealing its truly gorgeous API.

__&amp;#991; Blazingly fast:__
Cheerio works with a very simple, consistent DOM model. As a result parsing, manipulating, and rendering are incredibly efficient. Preliminary end-to-end benchmarks suggest that cheerio is about __8x__ faster than JSDOM.

__&amp;#10049; Incredibly flexible:__
Cheerio wraps around @FB55's forgiving [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/). Cheerio can parse nearly any HTML or XML document.

## API

### Markup example we'll be using:

```html
&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;pear&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

This is the HTML markup we will be using in all of the API examples.

### Loading
First you need to load in the HTML. This step in jQuery is implicit, since jQuery operates on the one, baked-in DOM. With Cheerio, we need to pass in the HTML document.

This is the _preferred_ method:

```js
var cheerio = require('cheerio'),
    $ = cheerio.load('&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;');
```

Optionally, you can also load in the HTML by passing the string as the context:

```js
$ = require('cheerio');
$('ul', '&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;');
```

Or as the root:

```js
$ = require('cheerio');
$('li', 'ul', '&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;');
```

You can also pass an extra object to `.load()` if you need to modify any
of the default parsing options:

```js
$ = cheerio.load('&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;', {
    normalizeWhitespace: true,
    xmlMode: true
});
```

These parsing options are taken directly from [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options), therefore any options that can be used in `htmlparser2` are valid in cheerio as well. The default options are:

```js
{
    withDomLvl1: true,
    normalizeWhitespace: false,
    xmlMode: false,
    decodeEntities: true
}

```

For a full list of options and their effects, see [this](https://github.com/fb55/DomHandler) and
[htmlparser2's options](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options).

### Selectors

Cheerio's selector implementation is nearly identical to jQuery's, so the API is very similar.

#### $( selector, [context], [root] )
`selector` searches within the `context` scope which searches within the `root` scope. `selector` and `context` can be a string expression, DOM Element, array of DOM elements, or cheerio object. `root` is typically the HTML document string.

This selector method is the starting point for traversing and manipulating the document. Like jQuery, it's the primary method for selecting elements in the document, but unlike jQuery it's built on top of the CSSSelect library, which implements most of the Sizzle selectors.

```js
$('.apple', '#fruits').text()
//=&gt; Apple

$('ul .pear').attr('class')
//=&gt; pear

$('li[class=orange]').html()
//=&gt; Orange
```

### Attributes
Methods for getting and modifying attributes.

#### .attr( name, value )
Method for getting and setting attributes. Gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set. If you set an attribute's value to `null`, you remove that attribute. You may also pass a `map` and `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('ul').attr('id')
//=&gt; fruits

$('.apple').attr('id', 'favorite').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot; id=&quot;favorite&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/attr/ for more information

#### .prop( name, value )
Method for getting and setting properties. Gets the property value for only the first element in the matched set.

```js
$('input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]').prop('checked')
//=&gt; false

$('input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]').prop('checked', true).val()
//=&gt; ok
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/prop/ for more information

#### .data( name, value )
Method for getting and setting data attributes. Gets or sets the data attribute value for only the first element in the matched set.

```js
$('&lt;div data-apple-color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').data()
//=&gt; { appleColor: 'red' }

$('&lt;div data-apple-color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').data('apple-color')
//=&gt; 'red'

var apple = $('.apple').data('kind', 'mac')
apple.data('kind')
//=&gt; 'mac'
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/data/ for more information

#### .val( [value] )
Method for getting and setting the value of input, select, and textarea. Note: Support for `map`, and `function` has not been added yet.

```js
$('input[type=&quot;text&quot;]').val()
//=&gt; input_text

$('input[type=&quot;text&quot;]').val('test').html()
//=&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;
```

#### .removeAttr( name )
Method for removing attributes by `name`.

```js
$('.pear').removeAttr('class').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;
```

#### .hasClass( className )
Check to see if *any* of the matched elements have the given `className`.

```js
$('.pear').hasClass('pear')
//=&gt; true

$('apple').hasClass('fruit')
//=&gt; false

$('li').hasClass('pear')
//=&gt; true
```

#### .addClass( className )
Adds class(es) to all of the matched elements. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.pear').addClass('fruit').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;pear fruit&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;

$('.apple').addClass('fruit red').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;apple fruit red&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ for more information.

#### .removeClass( [className] )
Removes one or more space-separated classes from the selected elements. If no `className` is defined, all classes will be removed. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.pear').removeClass('pear').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;

$('.apple').addClass('red').removeClass().html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ for more information.

#### .toggleClass( className, [switch] )
Add or remove class(es) from the matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red').html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;apple fruit red&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;

$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red', true).html()
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;apple green fruit red&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
```

&gt; See http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ for more information.

#### .is( selector )
#### .is( element )
#### .is( selection )
#### .is( function(index) )
Checks the current list of elements and returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match the selector. If using an element or Cheerio selection, returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match. If using a predicate function, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.

### Forms

#### .serializeArray()

Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.

```js
$('&lt;form&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;').serializeArray()
//=&gt; [ { name: 'foo', value: 'bar' } ]
```

### Traversing

#### .find(selector)
#### .find(selection)
#### .find(node)
Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.

//=&gt; 1
```

#### .parent([selector])

// =&gt; 2
$('.orange').parents('#fruits').length
// =&gt; 1
```

#### .parentsUntil([selector][,filter])
Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or cheerio object.
```js
$('.orange').parentsUntil('#food').length
// =&gt; 1
```

#### .closest(selector)
For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.

```js
$('.orange').closest()
// =&gt; []
$('.orange').closest('.apple')
// =&gt; []
$('.orange').closest('li')
// =&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;]
$('.orange').closest('#fruits')
// =&gt; [&lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt;]
```

#### .next([selector])
Gets the next sibling of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('.apple').next().hasClass('orange')
//=&gt; true
```

#### .nextAll([selector])
Gets all the following siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('.apple').nextAll()
//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;, &lt;li class=&quot;pear&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;]
$('.apple').nextAll('.orange')
//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;]
```

#### .nextUntil([selector], [filter])
Gets all the following siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.

```js
$('.apple').nextUntil('.pear')
//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;]
```

#### .prev([selector])
Gets the previous sibling of the first selected element optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('.orange').prev().hasClass('apple')
//=&gt; true
```

#### .prevAll([selector])
Gets all the preceding siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('.pear').prevAll()
//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;, &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;]
$('.pear').prevAll('.orange')
//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;]
```

#### .prevUntil([selector], [filter])
Gets all the preceding siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.

```js

//=&gt; [&lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;]
```

#### .slice( start, [end] )
Gets the elements matching the specified range

```js
$('li').slice(1).eq(0).text()
//=&gt; 'Orange'

$('li').slice(1, 2).length
//=&gt; 1
```

#### .siblings([selector])
Gets the first selected element's siblings, excluding itself.

```js
$('.pear').siblings().length
//=&gt; 2

$('.pear').siblings('.orange').length
//=&gt; 1

```

#### .children([selector])
Gets the children of the first selected element.

```js
$('#fruits').children().length
//=&gt; 3

$('#fruits').children('.pear').text()
//=&gt; Pear
```

#### .contents()
Gets the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.

```js
$('#fruits').contents().length
//=&gt; 3
```

#### .each( function(index, element) )
Iterates over a cheerio object, executing a function for each matched element. When the callback is fired, the function is fired in the context of the DOM element, so `this` refers to the current element, which is equivalent to the function parameter `element`. To break out of the `each` loop early, return with `false`.

```js
var fruits = [];

$('li').each(function(i, elem) {
  fruits[i] = $(this).text();
});

fruits.join(', ');
//=&gt; Apple, Orange, Pear
```

#### .map( function(index, element) )
Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new Cheerio object containing the return values. The function can return an individual data item or an array of data items to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned, the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.

```js
$('li').map(function(i, el) {
  // this === el
  return $(this).text();
}).get().join(' ');
//=&gt; &quot;apple orange pear&quot;
```

#### .filter( selector ) &lt;br /&gt; .filter( selection ) &lt;br /&gt; .filter( element ) &lt;br /&gt; .filter( function(index) )

Iterates over a cheerio object, reducing the set of selector elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. When a Cheerio selection is specified, return only the elements contained in that selection. When an element is specified, return only that element (if it is contained in the original selection). If using the function method, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.

Selector:

```js
$('li').filter('.orange').attr('class');
//=&gt; orange
```

Function:

```js
$('li').filter(function(i, el) {
  // this === el
  return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange';
}).attr('class')
//=&gt; orange
```

#### .not( selector ) &lt;br /&gt; .not( selection ) &lt;br /&gt; .not( element ) &lt;br /&gt; .not( function(index, elem) )

Remove elements from the set of matched elements. Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the `.not()` method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against each element; the elements that don't match the selector will be included in the result. The `.not()` method can take a function as its argument in the same way that `.filter()` does. Elements for which the function returns true are excluded from the filtered set; all other elements are included.

Selector:

```js
$('li').not('.apple').length;
//=&gt; 2
```

Function:

```js
$('li').not(function(i, el) {
  // this === el
  return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange';
}).length;
//=&gt; 2
```

#### .has( selector ) &lt;br /&gt; .has( element )

Filters the set of matched elements to only those which have the given DOM element as a descendant or which have a descendant that matches the given selector. Equivalent to `.filter(':has(selector)')`.

Selector:

```js
$('ul').has('.pear').attr('id');
//=&gt; fruits
```

Element:

```js
$('ul').has($('.pear')[0]).attr('id');
//=&gt; fruits
```

#### .first()
Will select the first element of a cheerio object

```js
$('#fruits').children().first().text()
//=&gt; Apple
```

#### .last()
Will select the last element of a cheerio object

```js
$('#fruits').children().last().text()
//=&gt; Pear
```

#### .eq( i )
Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. Use `.eq(-i)` to count backwards from the last selected element.

```js
$('li').eq(0).text()
//=&gt; Apple

$('li').eq(-1).text()
//=&gt; Pear
```

#### .get( [i] )

Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the Cheerio object. If an index is specified, retrieve one of the elements matched by the Cheerio object:

```js
$('li').get(0).tagName
//=&gt; li
```

If no index is specified, retrieve all elements matched by the Cheerio object:

```js
$('li').get().length
//=&gt; 3
```

#### .index()
#### .index( selector )
#### .index( nodeOrSelection )

Search for a given element from among the matched elements.

```js
$('.pear').index()
//=&gt; 2
$('.orange').index('li')
//=&gt; 1
$('.apple').index($('#fruit, li'))
//=&gt; 1
```

#### .end()
End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.

```js
$('li').eq(0).end().length
//=&gt; 3
```

#### .add( selector [, context] )
#### .add( element )
#### .add( elements )
#### .add( html )
#### .add( selection )
Add elements to the set of matched elements.

```js
$('.apple').add('.orange').length
//=&gt; 2
```

#### .addBack( [filter] )

Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set, optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('li').eq(0).addBack('.orange').length
//=&gt; 2
```

### Manipulation
Methods for modifying the DOM structure.

#### .append( content, [content, ...] )
Inserts content as the *last* child of each of the selected elements.

```js
$('ul').append('&lt;li class=&quot;plum&quot;&gt;Plum&lt;/li&gt;')

$.html()
//=&gt;  &lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;
//      &lt;li class=&quot;plum&quot;&gt;Plum&lt;/li&gt;

//    &lt;/ul&gt;
```

#### .prependTo( target )
Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target.

//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;mango&quot;&gt;Mango&lt;/li&gt;
```

#### .text( [textString] )
Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants.. If `textString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new text content.

```js
$('.orange').text()
//=&gt; Orange

$('ul').text()
//=&gt;  Apple
//    Orange
//    Pear
```

#### .wrap( content )
The .wrap() function can take any string or object that could be passed to the $() factory function to specify a DOM structure. This structure may be nested several levels deep, but should contain only one inmost element. A copy of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements. This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes.

```js
var redFruit = $('&lt;div class=&quot;red-fruit&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
$('.apple').wrap(redFruit)

//=&gt; &lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;
//     &lt;div class=&quot;red-fruit&quot;&gt;
//      &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
//     &lt;/div&gt;
//     &lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;
//     &lt;li class=&quot;plum&quot;&gt;Plum&lt;/li&gt;
//   &lt;/ul&gt;

var healthy = $('&lt;div class=&quot;healthy&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
$('li').wrap(healthy)

//=&gt; &lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;
//     &lt;div class=&quot;healthy&quot;&gt;
//       &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
//     &lt;/div&gt;
//     &lt;div class=&quot;healthy&quot;&gt;
//       &lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;
//     &lt;/div&gt;
//     &lt;div class=&quot;healthy&quot;&gt;
//        &lt;li class=&quot;plum&quot;&gt;Plum&lt;/li&gt;
//     &lt;/div&gt;
//   &lt;/ul&gt;
```

#### .css( [propertName] ) &lt;br /&gt; .css( [ propertyNames] ) &lt;br /&gt; .css( [propertyName], [value] ) &lt;br /&gt; .css( [propertName], [function] ) &lt;br /&gt; .css( [properties] )

Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.

### Rendering
When you're ready to render the document, you can use the `html` utility function:

```js
$.html()
//=&gt;  &lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;
//      &lt;li class=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
//      &lt;li class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/li&gt;
//      &lt;li class=&quot;pear&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;
//    &lt;/ul&gt;
```

If you want to return the outerHTML you can use `$.html(selector)`:

```js
$.html('.pear')
//=&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;pear&quot;&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt;
```

By default, `html` will leave some tags open. Sometimes you may instead want to render a valid XML document. For example, you might parse the following XML snippet:

```xml
$ = cheerio.load('&lt;media:thumbnail url=&quot;http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; time=&quot;12:05:01.123&quot;/&gt;');
```

... and later want to render to XML. To do this, you can use the 'xml' utility function:

```js
$.xml()
//=&gt;  &lt;media:thumbnail url=&quot;http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; time=&quot;12:05:01.123&quot;/&gt;
```

You may also render the text content of a Cheerio object using the `text` static method:

```js
$ = cheerio.load('This is &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.')
$.text()
//=&gt; This is content.
```

The method may be called on the Cheerio module itself--be sure to pass a collection of nodes!

```js
$ = cheerio.load('&lt;div&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;')
cheerio.text($('div'))
//=&gt; This is content.
```

### Miscellaneous
DOM element methods that don't fit anywhere else

#### .toArray()
Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set as an array.

```js
$('li').toArray()
//=&gt; [ {...}, {...}, {...} ]
```

#### .clone() ####
Clone the cheerio object.

```js
var moreFruit = $('#fruits').clone()
```

### Utilities

#### $.root

Sometimes you need to work with the top-level root element. To query it, you can use `$.root()`.

```js
$.root().append('&lt;ul id=&quot;vegetables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;').html();
//=&gt; &lt;ul id=&quot;fruits&quot;&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id=&quot;vegetables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
```

#### $.contains( container, contained )
Checks to see if the `contained` DOM element is a descendant of the `container` DOM element.

#### $.parseHTML( data [, context ] [, keepScripts ] )
Parses a string into an array of DOM nodes. The `context` argument has no meaning for Cheerio, but it is maintained for API compatability.

#### $.load( html[, options ] )
Load in the HTML. (See the previous section titled &quot;Loading&quot; for more information.)

### Plugins

Once you have loaded a document, you may extend the prototype or the equivalent `fn` property with custom plugin methods:

```js
var $ = cheerio.load('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;');
$.prototype.logHtml = function() {
  console.log(this.html());
};

$('body').logHtml(); // logs &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; to the console
```

### The &quot;DOM Node&quot; object

Cheerio collections are made up of objects that bear some resemblence to [browser-based DOM nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node). You can expect them to define the following properties:

- `tagName`
- `parentNode`
- `previousSibling`
- `nextSibling`
- `nodeValue`
- `firstChild`
- `childNodes`
- `lastChild`

## What about JSDOM?
I wrote cheerio because I found myself increasingly frustrated with JSDOM. For me, there were three main sticking points that I kept running into again and again:

__&amp;#8226; JSDOM's built-in parser is too strict:__
  JSDOM's bundled HTML parser cannot handle many popular sites out there today.

__&amp;#8226; JSDOM is too slow:__
Parsing big websites with JSDOM has a noticeable delay.

__&amp;#8226; JSDOM feels too heavy:__
The goal of JSDOM is to provide an identical DOM environment as what we see in the browser. I never really needed all this, I just wanted a simple, familiar way to do HTML manipulation.

## When I would use JSDOM

Cheerio will not solve all your problems. I would still use JSDOM if I needed to work in a browser-like environment on the server, particularly if I wanted to automate functional tests.

## Screencasts

&gt; This video tutorial is a follow-up to Nettut's &quot;How to Scrape Web Pages with Node.js and jQuery&quot;, using cheerio instead of JSDOM + jQuery. This video shows how easy it is to use cheerio and how much faster cheerio is than JSDOM + jQuery.

## Cheerio in the real world

Are you using cheerio in production? Add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/wiki/Cheerio-in-Production)!

## Testing

To run the test suite, download the repository, then within the cheerio directory, run:

```shell
make setup
make test
```

This will download the development packages and run the test suite.

## Special Thanks

This library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers. A special thanks to:

__&amp;#8226; @FB55 for node-htmlparser2 &amp; CSSSelect:__
Felix has a knack for writing speedy parsing engines. He completely re-wrote both @tautologistic's `node-htmlparser` and @harry's `node-soupselect` from the ground up, making both of them much faster and more flexible. Cheerio would not be possible without his foundational work

__&amp;#8226; @jQuery team for jQuery:__
The core API is the best of its class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow. Much of cheerio's implementation and documentation is from jQuery. Thanks guys.

__&amp;#8226; @visionmedia:__
The style, the structure, the open-source&quot;-ness&quot; of this library comes from studying TJ's style and using many of his libraries. This dude consistently pumps out high-quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions. You rock TJ.

&gt; A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / fsevents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/chokidar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png?downloads=true&amp;downloadRank=true&amp;stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&amp;type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for [brunch](http://brunch.io) (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On Mac OS X, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

    npm install chokidar --save

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) =&gt; {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error =&gt; log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () =&gt; log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) =&gt; {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) =&gt; {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also 
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
&quot;atomic writes&quot; instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods &amp; Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable &quot;python&quot; is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

&gt; A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / fsevents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/chokidar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png?downloads=true&amp;downloadRank=true&amp;stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&amp;type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for [brunch](http://brunch.io) (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On Mac OS X, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

    npm install chokidar --save

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) =&gt; {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error =&gt; log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () =&gt; log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) =&gt; {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) =&gt; {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also 
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
&quot;atomic writes&quot; instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods &amp; Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable &quot;python&quot; is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

=========

This utility allows you to render unicode-aided tables on the command line from
your node.js scripts.

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/sYq4T.png)

## Features

- Customizable characters that constitute the table.
- Color/background styling in the header through
  [colors.js](http://github.com/marak/colors.js)
- Column width customization
- Text truncation based on predefined widths
- Text alignment (left, right, center)
- Padding (left, right)
- Easy-to-use API

## Installation

```bash    
npm install cli-table
```

## How to use

### Horizontal Tables
```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');

// instantiate
var table = new Table({
    head: ['TH 1 label', 'TH 2 label']
  , colWidths: [100, 200]
});

// table is an Array, so you can `push`, `unshift`, `splice` and friends
table.push(
    ['First value', 'Second value']
  , ['First value', 'Second value']
);

console.log(table.toString());
```

### Vertical Tables
```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');
var table = new Table();

table.push(
    { 'Some key': 'Some value' }
  , { 'Another key': 'Another value' }
);

console.log(table.toString());
```
### Cross Tables
Cross tables are very similar to vertical tables, with two key differences:

1. They require a `head` setting when instantiated that has an empty string as the first header
2. The individual rows take the general form of { &quot;Header&quot;: [&quot;Row&quot;, &quot;Values&quot;] }

```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');
var table = new Table({ head: [&quot;&quot;, &quot;Top Header 1&quot;, &quot;Top Header 2&quot;] });

table.push(
    { 'Left Header 1': ['Value Row 1 Col 1', 'Value Row 1 Col 2'] }
  , { 'Left Header 2': ['Value Row 2 Col 1', 'Value Row 2 Col 2'] }
);

console.log(table.toString());
```

### Custom styles
The ```chars``` property controls how the table is drawn:
```javascript
var table = new Table({
  chars: { 'top': '═' , 'top-mid': '╤' , 'top-left': '╔' , 'top-right': '╗'
         , 'bottom': '═' , 'bottom-mid': '╧' , 'bottom-left': '╚' , 'bottom-right': '╝'
         , 'left': '║' , 'left-mid': '╟' , 'mid': '─' , 'mid-mid': '┼'
         , 'right': '║' , 'right-mid': '╢' , 'middle': '│' }
});

table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frob', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs:
//
//╔══════╤═════╤══════╗
//║ foo  │ bar │ baz  ║
//╟──────┼─────┼──────╢
//║ frob │ bar │ quuz ║
//╚══════╧═════╧══════╝
```

Empty decoration lines will be skipped, to avoid vertical separator rows just
set the 'mid', 'left-mid', 'mid-mid', 'right-mid' to the empty string:
```javascript
var table = new Table({ chars: {'mid': '', 'left-mid': '', 'mid-mid': '', 'right-mid': ''} });
table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs: (note the lack of the horizontal line between rows)
//┌────────────┬─────┬──────┐
//│ foo        │ bar │ baz  │
//│ frobnicate │ bar │ quuz │
//└────────────┴─────┴──────┘
```

By setting all chars to empty with the exception of 'middle' being set to a
single space and by setting padding to zero, it's possible to get the most
compact layout with no decorations:
```javascript
var table = new Table({
  chars: { 'top': '' , 'top-mid': '' , 'top-left': '' , 'top-right': ''
         , 'bottom': '' , 'bottom-mid': '' , 'bottom-left': '' , 'bottom-right': ''
         , 'left': '' , 'left-mid': '' , 'mid': '' , 'mid-mid': ''
         , 'right': '' , 'right-mid': '' , 'middle': ' ' },
  style: { 'padding-left': 0, 'padding-right': 0 }
});

table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs:
//foo        bar baz
//frobnicate bar quuz
```

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/co.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/co)

  Generator based flow-control goodness for nodejs and the browser, using
  thunks _or_ promises, letting you write non-blocking code in a nice-ish
  way.

  Co is careful to relay any errors that occur back to the generator, including those
  within the thunk, or from the thunk's callback. &quot;Uncaught&quot; exceptions in the generator
  are passed to `co()`'s thunk.

  Make sure to view the [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/co/tree/master/examples).

## Platform Compatibility

  When using node 0.11.x or greater, you must use the `--harmony-generators`
  flag or just `--harmony` to get access to generators.

  When using node 0.10.x and lower or browsers without generator support,
  you must use [gnode](https://github.com/TooTallNate/gnode) and/or [regenerator](http://facebook.github.io/regenerator/).

  When using node 0.8.x and lower or browsers without `setImmediate`,
  you must include a `setImmediate` polyfill.
  For a really simple polyfill, you may use [component/setimmediate.js](https://github.com/component/setimmediate.js).
  For a more robust polyfill, you may use [YuzuJS/setImmediate](https://github.com/YuzuJS/setImmediate).

## Installation

```
$ npm install co
```

## Associated libraries

  View the [wiki](https://github.com/visionmedia/co/wiki) for libraries that
  work well with Co.

## Example

```js
var co = require('co');
var thunkify = require('thunkify');
var request = require('request');
var get = thunkify(request.get);

co(function *(){
  var a = yield get('http://google.com');
  var b = yield get('http://yahoo.com');
  var c = yield get('http://cloudup.com');
  console.log(a[0].statusCode);
  console.log(b[0].statusCode);
  console.log(c[0].statusCode);
})()

co(function *(){
  var a = get('http://google.com');
  var b = get('http://yahoo.com');
  var c = get('http://cloudup.com');
  var res = yield [a, b, c];
  console.log(res);
})()

// Error handling

co(function *(){
  try {
    var res = yield get('http://badhost.invalid');
    console.log(res);
  } catch(e) {
    console.log(e.code) // ENOTFOUND
 }
})()
```

## Yieldables

  The &quot;yieldable&quot; objects currently supported are:

  - promises
  - thunks (functions)
  - array (parallel execution)
  - objects (parallel execution)
  - generators (delegation)
  - generator functions (delegation)

To convert a regular node function that accepts a callback into one which returns a thunk you may want to use [thunkify](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-thunkify) or similar.

## Thunks vs promises

  While co supports promises, you may return &quot;thunks&quot; from your functions,
  which otherwise behaves just like the traditional node-style callback
  with a signature of: `(err, result)`.


  For example take `fs.readFile`, we all know the signature is:

```js
fs.readFile(path, encoding, function(err, result){

});
```

  To work with Co we need a function to return another function of
  the same signature:

```js
fs.readFile(path, encoding)(function(err, result){

});
```

  Which basically looks like this:

```js
function read(path, encoding) {
  return function(cb){
    fs.readFile(path, encoding, cb);
  }
}
```

  or to execute immediately like this (see [`thunkify`](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-thunkify)):

```js
function read(path, encoding) {
  // call fs.readFile immediately, store result later
  return function(cb){
    // cb(err, result) or when result ready
  }
}
```

## Receiver propagation

  When `co` is invoked with a receiver it will propagate to most yieldables,
  allowing you to alter `this`.

```js
var ctx = {};

function foo() {
  assert(this == ctx);
}

co(function *(){
  assert(this == ctx);
  yield foo;
}).call(ctx)
```

  You also pass arguments through the generator:

```js
co(function *(a){
  assert(this == ctx);
  assert('yay' == a);
  yield foo;
}).call(ctx, 'yay');
```

## API

### co(fn)

  Pass a generator `fn` and return a thunk. The thunk's signature is
  `(err, result)`, where `result` is the value passed to the `return`
  statement.

```js
var co = require('co');
var fs = require('fs');

function read(file) {
  return function(fn){
    fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', fn);
  }
}

co(function *(){
  var a = yield read('.gitignore');
  var b = yield read('Makefile');
  var c = yield read('package.json');
  return [a, b, c];
})()
```

  You may also yield `Generator` objects to support nesting:


```js
var co = require('co');
var fs = require('fs');

function size(file) {
  return function(fn){
    fs.stat(file, function(err, stat){
      if (err) return fn(err);
      fn(null, stat.size);
    });
  }
}

function *foo(){
  var a = yield size('.gitignore');
  var b = yield size('Makefile');
  var c = yield size('package.json');
  return [a, b, c];
}

function *bar(){
  var a = yield size('examples/parallel.js');
  var b = yield size('examples/nested.js');
  var c = yield size('examples/simple.js');
  return [a, b, c];
}

co(function *(){
  var results = yield [foo(), bar()];
  console.log(results);
})()
```

  Or if the generator functions do not require arguments, simply `yield` the function:

```js
var co = require('co');
var thunkify = require('thunkify');
var request = require('request');

var get = thunkify(request.get);

function *results() {
  var a = get('http://google.com')
  var b = get('http://yahoo.com')
  var c = get('http://ign.com')
  return yield [a, b, c]
}

co(function *(){
  // 3 concurrent requests at a time
  var a = yield results;
  var b = yield results;
  console.log(a, b);

  // 6 concurrent requests
  console.log(yield [results, results]);
})()
```

  If a thunk is written to execute immediately you may achieve parallelism
  by simply `yield`-ing _after_ the call. The following are equivalent if
  each call kicks off execution immediately:

```js
co(function *(){
  var a = size('package.json');
  var b = size('Readme.md');
  var c = size('Makefile');

  return [yield a, yield b, yield c];
})()
```

  Or:

```js
co(function *(){
  var a = size('package.json');
  var b = size('Readme.md');
  var c = size('Makefile');

  return yield [a, b, c];
})()
```

  You can also pass arguments into the generator. The last argument, `done`, is
  the callback function. Here's an example:

```js
var exec = require('co-exec');
co(function *(cmd) {
  var res = yield exec(cmd);
  return res;
})('pwd', done);
```

### yield array

  By yielding an array of thunks you may &quot;join&quot; them all into a single thunk which executes them all concurrently,
  instead of in sequence. Note that the resulting array ordering _is_ retained.

```js

var co = require('co');
var fs = require('fs');

function size(file) {
  return function(fn){
    fs.stat(file, function(err, stat){
      if (err) return fn(err);
      fn(null, stat.size);
    });
  }
}

co(function *(){
  var a = size('.gitignore');
  var b = size('index.js');
  var c = size('Makefile');
  var res = yield [a, b, c];
  console.log(res);
  // =&gt; [ 13, 1687, 129 ]
})()
```

Nested arrays may also be expressed as simple nested arrays:

```js
var a = [
  get('http://google.com'),
  get('http://yahoo.com'),
  get('http://ign.com')
];

var b = [
  get('http://google.com'),
  get('http://yahoo.com'),
  get('http://ign.com')
];

console.log(yield [a, b]);
```

### yield object

  Yielding an object behaves much like yielding an array, however recursion is supported:

```js
co(function *(){
  var user = yield {
    name: {
      first: get('name.first'),
      last: get('name.last')
    }
  };
})()
```

  Here is the sequential equivalent without yielding an object:

```js
co(function *(){
  var user = {
    name: {
      first: yield get('name.first'),
      last: yield get('name.last')
    }
  };
})()
```

### Performance

  On my machine 30,000 sequential stat()s takes an avg of 570ms,
  while the same number of sequential stat()s with `co()` takes
  610ms, aka the overhead introduced by generators is _extremely_ negligible.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/veged/coa.png)](http://travis-ci.org/veged/coa)

## What is it?

COA is a parser for command line options that aim to get maximum profit from formalization your program API.
Once you write definition in terms of commands, options and arguments you automaticaly get:

* Command line help text
* Program API for use COA-based programs as modules
* Shell completion

### Other features

* Rich types for options and arguments, such as arrays, boolean flags and required
* Commands can be async throught using promising (powered by [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q))
* Easy submoduling some existing commands to new top-level one
* Combined validation and complex parsing of values

### TODO

* Localization
* Shell-mode
* Configs
 * Aliases
 * Defaults

## Examples

````javascript
require('coa').Cmd() // main (top level) command declaration
    .name(process.argv[1]) // set top level command name from program name
    .title('My awesome command line util') // title for use in text messages
    .helpful() // make command &quot;helpful&quot;, i.e. options -h --help with usage message
    .opt() // add some option
        .name('version') // name for use in API
        .title('Version') // title for use in text messages
        .short('v') // short key: -v
        .long('version') // long key: --version
        .flag() // for options without value
        .act(function(opts) { // add action for option
            // return message as result of action
            return JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(__dirname + '/package.json'))
                .version;

&gt; Turn a CSS color into its smallest representation.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/colormin) do:

```
npm install colormin --save
```


## Example

```js
var colormin = require('colormin');
console.log(colormin('rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)'));

// =&gt; 'red'
```

colormin works for rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, hex &amp; css color keywords. See more
example output in the [tests](src/__tests__/index.js). Note that colormin does
not convert invalid CSS colors, as it is not a color validator.


## API

### colormin(color, [options])

#### color

Type: `string`  

The color to minify.

#### options

##### legacy

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to enable IE &lt; 10 compatibility; the browser chokes on the
`transparent` keyword, so in this mode the conversion from `rgba(0,0,0,0)`
is turned off.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you add functionality, then please add unit tests
to cover it.

## Usage

By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!

The super nifty way

```js
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass

```

or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass

```

I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. 

If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.

## Disabling Colors

To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:

```bash
node myapp.js --no-color
```

## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)

```js
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -&gt; 'Hello Marak'
```

## Custom themes

### Using standard API

```js

var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(&quot;this is an error&quot;.error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log(&quot;this is a warning&quot;.warn);
```

### Using string safe API

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error(&quot;this is an error&quot;));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn(&quot;this is a warning&quot;));
```

*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*</pre></section></details><details><summary>colors@1.1.2</summary><section><h3>colors@1.1.2</h3><pre>Original Library

__NOTE__: you must still install the engines you wish to use, add them to your package.json dependencies.

## API

  All templates supported by this library may be rendered using the signature `(path[, locals], callback)` as shown below, which happens to be the signature that Express 3.x supports so any of these engines may be used within Express.

__NOTE__: All this example code uses cons.swig for the swig template engine. Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  Or without options / local variables:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate')
  , name = 'swig';

cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

### Promises

  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');

cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })
  .then(function (html) {
    console.log(html);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    throw err;
  });
```

## Caching

 To enable or disable caching simply pass `{ cache: true/false }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', { cache: false, user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

## Express 3.x example

```js
var express = require('express')
  , cons = require('consolidate')
  , app = express();

// assign the swig engine to .html files
app.engine('html', cons.swig);

// set .html as the default extension
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');

var users = [];
users.push({ name: 'tobi' });
users.push({ name: 'loki' });
users.push({ name: 'jane' });

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.render('index', {
    title: 'Consolidate.js'
  });
});

app.get('/users', function(req, res){
  res.render('users', {
    title: 'Users',
    users: users
  });
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('Express server listening on port 3000');
```

## Template Engine Instances

Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate'),
  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');

// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be
// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method
cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();

cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {
  return 'bar';
});
```

## Notes

* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).
* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`
* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader
  with `options.loader`.
* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.
* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.
* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`.
* `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.

In io.js or node &gt;= 0.11 this module is just a shortcut to crypto.createECDH.  In node &lt;= 0.11 or the browser this is a pure JavaScript implimentation, more specifically a wrapper around [elliptic](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic), to give it the same API as node. `secp256k1`, `secp224r1` (aka p224), `prime256v1` (aka p256, secp256r1), `prime192v1` (aka p192, secp192r1), `secp384r1` (aka p384), `secp521r1` (aka p521)  curves all work in both this library and node (though only the highlighted name will work in node).</pre></section></details><details><summary>create-error-class@3.0.2</summary><section><h3>create-error-class@3.0.2</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

===============

A JSON Object of css color names mapped to their hex value

Usage
-----

``` js
var csscolors = require('css-color-names');
console.dir(csscolors);
```

yields

``` json
{
  &quot;aqua&quot;: &quot;#00ffff&quot;,
  &quot;aliceblue&quot;: &quot;#f0f8ff&quot;,
  &quot;antiquewhite&quot;: &quot;#faebd7&quot;,
  &quot;black&quot;: &quot;#000000&quot;,
  &quot;blue&quot;: &quot;#0000ff&quot;,
  ...
}
```

How was this list generated?
----------------------------

In the Makefile you'll see a line like this:

	./getcolors.sh | ./stringify.js &gt; $(FILE)

The first command scrapes a site for the list,
and outputs the results separated by newlines.  The
second command creates the JSON object and outputs
it to stdout, which then gets redirected into
`css-color-names.json`

  JavaScript CSS parser for nodejs and the browser.

## Installation

  $ npm install css-parse

## Usage

````javascript
var parse = require('css-parse');

// CSS input string
var css = &quot;body { \n background-color: #fff;\n }&quot;;

var output_obj = parse(css);

// Position and Source parameters
var output_obj_pos = parse(css, { position: true, source: 'file.css' });

// Print parsed object as CSS string
console.log(JSON.stringify(output_obj, null, 2));

````

## Example

css:

```css
body {
  background: #eee;
  color: #888;
}
```

parse tree:

```json
{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stylesheet&quot;,
  &quot;stylesheet&quot;: {
    &quot;rules&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;rule&quot;,
        &quot;selectors&quot;: [
          &quot;body&quot;
        ],
        &quot;declarations&quot;: [
          {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;declaration&quot;,
            &quot;property&quot;: &quot;background&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#eee&quot;
          },
          {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;declaration&quot;,
            &quot;property&quot;: &quot;color&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#888&quot;
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

parse tree with `.position` enabled:

```json
{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stylesheet&quot;,
  &quot;stylesheet&quot;: {
    &quot;rules&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;rule&quot;,
        &quot;selectors&quot;: [
          &quot;body&quot;
        ],
        &quot;declarations&quot;: [
          {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;declaration&quot;,
            &quot;property&quot;: &quot;background&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#eee&quot;,
            &quot;position&quot;: {
              &quot;start&quot;: {
                &quot;line&quot;: 3,
                &quot;column&quot;: 3
              },
              &quot;end&quot;: {
                &quot;line&quot;: 3,
                &quot;column&quot;: 19
              }
            }
          },
          {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;declaration&quot;,
            &quot;property&quot;: &quot;color&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#888&quot;,
            &quot;position&quot;: {
              &quot;start&quot;: {
                &quot;line&quot;: 4,
                &quot;column&quot;: 3
              },
              &quot;end&quot;: {
                &quot;line&quot;: 4,
                &quot;column&quot;: 14
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        &quot;position&quot;: {
          &quot;start&quot;: {
            &quot;line&quot;: 2,
            &quot;column&quot;: 1
          },
          &quot;end&quot;: {
            &quot;line&quot;: 5,
            &quot;column&quot;: 2
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you also pass in `source: 'path/to/original.css'`, that will be set
on `node.position.source`.

Provides some base functions needed by a 
[`css-select`](https://github.com/fb55/css-select) adapter so that you don't
have to implement the whole thing.

## usage

```javascript
var baseAdapter = require('css-select-base-adapter');

var myAdapter = {
  // your partial implementation here
};

// get an adapter with everything needed by css-select
var adapter = baseAdapter(myAdapter);

// use adapter with css-select...
```

## how it works

An adapter for `css-select` requires the following functions to be implemented:

```
isTag, existsOne, getAttributeValue, getChildren, getName, getParent,
getSiblings, getText, hasAttrib, removeSubsets, findAll, findOne
```

You can pass this module a more minimal implementation and it will return a full 
adapter that fills in any missing functions, provided that you implement at 
least:  

```
isTag, getAttributeValue, getChildren, getName, getParent, getText
```

If you provide any of the other methods required of an adapter, the base adapter 
will use your implementation instead of its own.

See the 
[`css-select` readme](https://github.com/fb55/css-select/blob/master/README.md)
for more information on the required function signatures.</pre></section></details><details><summary>css-select@1.2.0</summary><section><h3>css-select@1.2.0</h3><pre>Copyright (c) Felix Böhm

A JavaScript library for escaping CSS strings and identifiers while generating the shortest possible ASCII-only output.

This is a JavaScript library for [escaping text for use in CSS strings or identifiers](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes) while generating the shortest possible valid ASCII-only output. [Here’s an online demo.](http://mothereff.in/css-escapes)

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

## Installation

Via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install cssesc
```

Via [Component](https://github.com/component/component):

```bash
component install mathiasbynens/cssesc
```

Via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```bash
npm install cssesc
```

In a browser:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;cssesc.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var cssesc = require('cssesc');
```

In [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/):

```js
var cssesc = require('cssesc').cssesc;
```

In [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):

```js
load('cssesc.js');
```

Using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):

```js
require(
  {
    'paths': {
      'cssesc': 'path/to/cssesc'
    }
  },
  ['cssesc'],
  function(cssesc) {
    console.log(cssesc);
  }
);
```

## API

### `cssesc(value, options)`

This function takes a value and returns an escaped version of the value where any characters that are not printable ASCII symbols are escaped using the shortest possible (but valid) [escape sequences for use in CSS strings or identifiers](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes).

```js
cssesc('Ich ♥ Bücher');
// → 'Ich \\2665  B\\FC cher'

cssesc('foo 𝌆 bar');
// → 'foo \\1D306  bar'
```

By default, `cssesc` returns a string that can be used as part of a CSS string. If the target is a CSS identifier rather than a CSS string, use the `isIdentifier: true` setting (see below).

The optional `options` argument accepts an object with the following options:

#### `isIdentifier`

The default value for the `isIdentifier` option is `false`. This means that the input text will be escaped for use in a CSS string literal. If you want to use the result as a CSS identifier instead (in a selector, for example), set this option to `true`.

```js
cssesc('123a2b');
// → '123a2b'

cssesc('123a2b', {
  'isIdentifier': true
});
// → '\\31 23a2b'
```

#### `quotes`

The default value for the `quotes` option is `'single'`. This means that any occurences of `'` in the input text will be escaped as `\'`, so that the output can be used in a CSS string literal wrapped in single quotes.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.');
// → 'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'
// → &quot;Lorem ipsum \&quot;dolor\&quot; sit \\'amet\\' etc.&quot;

cssesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single'
});
// → 'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'
// → &quot;Lorem ipsum \&quot;dolor\&quot; sit \\'amet\\' etc.&quot;
```

If you want to use the output as part of a CSS string literal wrapped in double quotes, set the `quotes` option to `'double'`.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double'
});
// → 'Lorem ipsum \\&quot;dolor\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.'
// → &quot;Lorem ipsum \\\&quot;dolor\\\&quot; sit 'amet' etc.&quot;
```

#### `wrap`

The `wrap` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, the output will be a valid CSS string literal wrapped in quotes. The type of quotes can be specified through the `quotes` setting.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single',
  'wrap': true
});
// → '\'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\''
// → &quot;\'Lorem ipsum \&quot;dolor\&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\'&quot;

cssesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double',
  'wrap': true
});
// → '&quot;Lorem ipsum \\&quot;dolor\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.&quot;'
// → &quot;\&quot;Lorem ipsum \\\&quot;dolor\\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.\&quot;&quot;
```

#### `escapeEverything`

The `escapeEverything` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, all the symbols in the output will be escaped, even printable ASCII symbols.

```js
cssesc('lolwat&quot;foo\'bar', {
  'escapeEverything': true
});
// → '\\6C\\6F\\6C\\77\\61\\74\\&quot;\\66\\6F\\6F\\\'\\62\\61\\72'
// → &quot;\\6C\\6F\\6C\\77\\61\\74\\\&quot;\\66\\6F\\6F\\'\\62\\61\\72&quot;
```

### `cssesc.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

### Using the `cssesc` binary

To use the `cssesc` binary in your shell, simply install cssesc globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g cssesc
```

After that you will be able to escape text for use in CSS strings or identifiers from the command line:

```bash
$ cssesc 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz'
f\F6o \2665  b\E5r \1D306  baz
```

If the output needs to be a CSS identifier rather than part of a string literal, use the `-i`/`--identifier` option:

```bash
$ cssesc --identifier 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz'
f\F6o\ \2665\ b\E5r\ \1D306\ baz
```

See `cssesc --help` for the full list of options.

## Support

This library has been tested in at least Chrome 28-30, Firefox 3-23, Safari 4-6, Opera 10-15, IE 6-10, Node.js v0.10.0, Narwhal 0.3.2, RingoJS 0.8-0.9, PhantomJS 1.9.0, and Rhino 1.7RC4.

## Unit tests &amp; code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate [the code coverage report](http://rawgithub.com/mathiasbynens/cssesc/master/coverage/cssesc/cssesc.js.html), use `grunt cover`.

cssnano is a modular minifier that aims to utilise small modules from the
PostCSS ecosystem, rather than being an all-encompassing module that may be
difficult to contribute to. Because it is written on top of PostCSS, it is able
to do more than simple whitespace transforms - including advanced optimisations
such as custom identifier reduction, `z-index` rebasing, and adjacent selector
merging.

Note that cssnano enables aggressive optimisations by default, which might not
always be what you want. Set `options.safe` to `true` if you want to disable
this. In future versions, only safe options will be enabled by default, starting
from [version 4][v4].

For further details check out the [website](http://cssnano.co/):

* [Installation guide for your build process](http://cssnano.co/usage/).
* [Full list of optimisations](http://cssnano.co/optimisations/).
* [Customise the output (options documentation)](http://cssnano.co/options/).

You can now [try cssnano online](https://runkit.com/npm/cssnano) via Runkit!

Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript.
It is available through npm

	npm install cyclist

## What?

Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic.
In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one.
This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data
packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.

## Usage

``` js
var cyclist = require('cyclist');
var list = cyclist(4); // if size (4) is not a power of 2 it will be the follwing power of 2
                       // this buffer can now hold 4 elements in total

list.put(42, 'hello 42'); // store something and index 42
list.put(43, 'hello 43'); // store something and index 43

console.log(list.get(42)); // prints hello 42
console.log(list.get(46)); // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size
```

## API

* `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer
* `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer
* `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer
* `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index
* `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer

  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.

## Installation

```
$ npm install debug
```

## Usage

 With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.
 
Example _app.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('http')
  , http = require('http')
  , name = 'My App';

// fake app

debug('booting %s', name);

http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);
  res.end('hello\n');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug('listening');
});

// fake worker of some kind

require('./worker');
```

Example _worker.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('worker');

setInterval(function(){
  debug('doing some work');
}, 1000);
```

 The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:

  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)

  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)

## Millisecond diff

  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the &quot;+NNNms&quot; will show you how much time was spent between calls.

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)

  When stderr is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:
  _(NOTE: Debug now uses stderr instead of stdout, so the correct shell command for this example is actually `DEBUG=* node example/worker 2&gt; out &amp;`)_
  
  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)
  
## Conventions

 If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use &quot;:&quot; to separate features. For example &quot;bodyParser&quot; from Connect would then be &quot;connect:bodyParser&quot;. 

## Wildcards

  The &quot;*&quot; character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named &quot;connect:bodyParser&quot;, &quot;connect:compress&quot;, &quot;connect:session&quot;, instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a &quot;-&quot; character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with &quot;connect:&quot;.

## Browser support

 Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`. 

```js
a = debug('worker:a');
b = debug('worker:b');

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1000);

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1200);
```

==========

Node's `assert.deepEqual() algorithm` as a standalone module. Exactly like
[deep-equal](https://github.com/substack/node-deep-equal) except for the fact that `deepEqual(NaN, NaN) === true`.

This module is around [5 times faster](https://gist.github.com/2790507)
than wrapping `assert.deepEqual()` in a `try/catch`.

[![browser support](http://ci.testling.com/thlorenz/deep-is.png)](http://ci.testling.com/thlorenz/deep-is)

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/deep-is.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/deep-is)

example
=======

``` js
var equal = require('deep-is');
console.dir([
    equal(
        { a : [ 2, 3 ], b : [ 4 ] },
        { a : [ 2, 3 ], b : [ 4 ] }
    ),
    equal(
        { x : 5, y : [6] },
        { x : 5, y : 6 }
    )
]);
```

methods
=======

var deepIs = require('deep-is')

deepIs(a, b)
---------------

Compare objects `a` and `b`, returning whether they are equal according to a
recursive equality algorithm.

install
=======

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install deep-is
```

test
====

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm test
```

license
=======

MIT. Derived largely from node's assert module.</pre></section></details><details><summary>deep-is@0.1.3</summary><section><h3>deep-is@0.1.3</h3><pre>Copyright (c) 2012, 2013 Thorsten Lorenz &lt;thlorenz@gmx.de&gt;

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

  &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
  and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

  &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
  the copyright owner that is granting the License.

  &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
  other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
  &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

  &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
  exercising permissions granted by this License.

  &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
  source, and configuration files.

  &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
  and conversions to other media types.

  &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

  &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

  &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

  &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This repository provides a mapping of Electron versions to the Chromium version that it uses.

This package is used in [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist), so you can use e.g. `electron &gt;= 1.4` in [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) and [eslint-plugin-compat](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat).

## Install
Install using `npm install electron-to-chromium`.

## Usage
To include Electron-to-Chromium, require it:

```js
var e2c = require('electron-to-chromium');
```

### Properties
The Electron-to-Chromium object has 4 properties to use:

#### `versions`
An object of key-value pairs with a _major_ Electron version as the key, and the corresponding major Chromium version as the value.

```js
var versions = e2c.versions;
console.log(versions['1.4']);
// returns &quot;53&quot;
```

#### `fullVersions`
An object of key-value pairs with a Electron version as the key, and the corresponding full Chromium version as the value.

```js
var versions = e2c.fullVersions;
console.log(versions['1.4.11']);
// returns &quot;53.0.2785.143&quot;
```

#### `chromiumVersions`
An object of key-value pairs with a _major_ Chromium version as the key, and the corresponding major Electron version as the value.

```js
var versions = e2c.chromiumVersions;
console.log(versions['54']);
// returns &quot;1.4&quot;
```

#### `fullChromiumVersions`
An object of key-value pairs with a Chromium version as the key, and an array of the corresponding major Electron versions as the value.

```js
var versions = e2c.fullChromiumVersions;
console.log(versions['54.0.2840.101']);
// returns [&quot;1.5.1&quot;, &quot;1.5.0&quot;]
```
### Functions

#### `electronToChromium(query)`
Arguments:
* Query: string or number, required. A major or full Electron version.

A function that returns the corresponding Chromium version for a given Electron function. Returns a string.

If you provide it with a major Electron version, it will return a major Chromium version:

```js
var chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('1.4');
// chromeVersion is &quot;53&quot;
```

If you provide it with a full Electron version, it will return the full Chromium version.

```js
var chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('1.4.11');
// chromeVersion is &quot;53.0.2785.143&quot;
```

If a query does not match a Chromium version, it will return `undefined`.

```js
var chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('9000');
// chromeVersion is undefined
```

#### `chromiumToElectron(query)`
Arguments:
* Query: string or number, required. A major or full Chromium version.

Returns a string with the corresponding Electron version for a given Chromium query.

If you provide it with a major Chromium version, it will return a major Electron version:

```js
var electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('54');
// electronVersion is &quot;1.4&quot;
```

If you provide it with a full Chrome version, it will return an array of full Electron versions.

```js
var electronVersions = e2c.chromiumToElectron('56.0.2924.87');
// electronVersions is [&quot;1.6.3&quot;, &quot;1.6.2&quot;, &quot;1.6.1&quot;, &quot;1.6.0&quot;]
```

If a query does not match an Electron version, it will return `undefined`.

```js
var electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('10');
// chromeVersion is undefined
```

#### `electronToBrowserList(query)` **DEPRECATED**
Arguments:
* Query: string or number, required. A major Electron version.

_**Deprecated**: Browserlist already includes electron-to-chromium._

A function that returns a [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) query that matches the given major Electron version. Returns a string.

If you provide it with a major Electron version, it will return a Browserlist query string that matches the Chromium capabilities:

```js
var query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('1.4');
// query is &quot;Chrome &gt;= 53&quot;
```

If a query does not match a Chromium version, it will return `undefined`.

```js
var query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('9000');
// query is undefined
```

### Importing just versions, fullVersions, chromiumVersions and fullChromiumVersions
All lists can be imported on their own, if file size is a concern.

#### `versions`

```js
var versions = require('electron-to-chromium/versions');
```

#### `fullVersions`

```js
var fullVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-versions');
```

#### `chromiumVersions`

```js
var chromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/chromium-versions');
```

#### `fullChromiumVersions`

```js
var fullChromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-chromium-versions');
```

## Updating
This package will be updated with each new Electron release.

To update the list, run `npm run build.js`. Requires internet access as it downloads from the canonical list of Electron versions.

To verify correct behaviour, run `npm test`.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign message (must be an array, or it'll be treated as a hex sequence)
var msg = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msg);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Public key as '04 + x + y'
var pub = '04bb1fa3...';

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) hex-string of DER-encoded signature; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s)

var signature = 'b102ac...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign message (must be an array, or it'll be treated as a hex sequence)
var msg = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msg).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

	npm install end-of-stream

## Usage

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.
Both legacy streams and streams2 are supported.

``` js
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended');
});

eos(writableStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');

Offers an async require.resolve function. It's highly configurable.

## Features

* plugin system
* provide a custom filesystem
* sync and async node.js filesystems included


## Getting Started
### Install
```sh
# npm
npm install enhanced-resolve
# or Yarn
yarn add enhanced-resolve
```

### Creating a Resolver
The easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.
```js
const {
  NodeJsInputFileSystem,
  CachedInputFileSystem,
  ResolverFactory
} = require('enhanced-resolve');

// create a resolver
const myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({
  // Typical usage will consume the `NodeJsInputFileSystem` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps the Node.js `fs` wrapper to add resilience + caching.
  fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(new NodeJsInputFileSystem(), 4000),
  extensions: ['.js', '.json']
  /* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */
});

// resolve a file with the new resolver
const context = {};
const lookupStartPath = '/Users/webpack/some/root/dir';
const request = './path/to-look-up.js';
myResolver.resolve({}, lookupStartPath, request, (err/*Error*/, filepath/*string*/) =&gt; {
  // Do something with the path
});
```

For more examples creating different types resolvers (sync/async, context, etc) see `lib/node.js`.

| cachePredicate           | function() { return true }; | A function which decides whether a request should be cached or not. An object is passed to the function with `path` and `request` properties. |

| resolver                 | undefined                   | A prepared Resolver to which the plugins are attached |

## Plugins
Similar to `webpack`, the core of `enhanced-resolve` functionality is implemented as individual plugins that are executed using [`Tapable`](https://github.com/webpack/tapable). These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.

A plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.

### Plugin Boilerplate
```js
class MyResolverPlugin {
  constructor(source, target) {
    this.source = source;
    this.target = target;
  }

  apply(resolver) {
    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) =&gt; {
      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here
      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);
    });
  }
}
```

Plugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.

## Tests

``` javascript
npm test
```

## Passing options from webpack
If you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:

```
resolve: {
  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],
  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],
  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]
  ...
},
```

&gt; Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling &amp; reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.

* [Custom errors](#customerrors)

&lt;a name=&quot;errnoexposed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     &quot;errno&quot;: 3,
//     &quot;code&quot;: &quot;EACCES&quot;,
//     &quot;description&quot;: &quot;permission denied&quot;
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     &quot;errno&quot;: 53,
//     &quot;code&quot;: &quot;ENOTEMPTY&quot;,
//     &quot;description&quot;: &quot;directory not empty&quot;
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  &quot;errno&quot;: 53,
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;ENOTEMPTY&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;directory not empty&quot;
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  &quot;errno&quot;: 56,
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;EROFS&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;read-only file system&quot;
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: &quot;foo&quot;
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

&lt;a name=&quot;customerrors&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `&quot;iteration&quot;`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

&gt; Run some code when the process exits

The `process.on('exit')` event doesn't catch all the ways a process can exit.

Useful for cleaning up.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save exit-hook
```


## Usage

```js
var exitHook = require('exit-hook');

exitHook(function () {
	console.log('exiting');
});

// you can add multiple hooks, even across files
exitHook(function () {
	console.log('exiting 2');
});

throw new Error('unicorns');

//=&gt; exiting
//=&gt; exiting 2

A very simple and stupid parser, based on a statemachine and regular expressions.

It's not intended for complex languages. It's intended to easily write a simple parser for a simple language.



## Usage

Pass a description of statemachine to the constructor. The description must be in this form:

``` javascript
new Parser(description)

description is {
	// The key is the name of the state
	// The value is an object containing possible transitions
	&quot;state-name&quot;: {
		// The key is a regular expression
		// If the regular expression matches the transition is executed
		// The value can be &quot;true&quot;, a other state name or a function

		&quot;a&quot;: true,
		// true will make the parser stay in the current state
		
		&quot;b&quot;: &quot;other-state-name&quot;,
		// a string will make the parser transit to a new state
		
		&quot;[cde]&quot;: function(match, index, matchLength) {
			// &quot;match&quot; will be the matched string
			// &quot;index&quot; will be the position in the complete string
			// &quot;matchLength&quot; will be &quot;match.length&quot;
			
			// &quot;this&quot; will be the &quot;context&quot; passed to the &quot;parse&quot; method&quot;
			
			// A new state name (string) can be returned
			return &quot;other-state-name&quot;;
		},
		
		&quot;([0-9]+)(\\.[0-9]+)?&quot;: function(match, first, second, index, matchLength) {
			// groups can be used in the regular expression
			// they will match to arguments &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;
		},
		
		// the parser stops when it cannot match the string anymore
		
		// order of keys is the order in which regular expressions are matched
		// if the javascript runtime preserves the order of keys in an object
		// (this is not standardized, but it's a de-facto standard)
	}
}
```

The statemachine is compiled down to a single regular expression per state. So basically the parsing work is delegated to the (native) regular expression logic of the javascript runtime.


``` javascript
Parser.prototype.parse(initialState: String, parsedString: String, context: Object)
```

`initialState`: state where the parser starts to parse.

`parsedString`: the string which should be parsed.

`context`: an object which can be used to save state and results. Available as `this` in transition functions.

returns `context`




## Example

``` javascript
var Parser = require(&quot;fastparse&quot;);

// A simple parser that extracts @licence ... from comments in a JS file
var parser = new Parser({
	// The &quot;source&quot; state
	&quot;source&quot;: {
		// matches comment start
		&quot;/\\*&quot;: &quot;comment&quot;,
		&quot;//&quot;: &quot;linecomment&quot;,
		
		// this would be necessary for a complex language like JS
		// but omitted here for simplicity
		// &quot;\&quot;&quot;: &quot;string1&quot;,
		// &quot;\'&quot;: &quot;string2&quot;,
		// &quot;\/&quot;: &quot;regexp&quot;
		
	},
	// The &quot;comment&quot; state
	&quot;comment&quot;: {
		&quot;\\*/&quot;: &quot;source&quot;,
		&quot;@licen[cs]e\\s((?:[^*\n]|\\*+[^*/\n])*)&quot;: function(match, licenseText) {
			this.licences.push(licenseText.trim());
		}
	},
	// The &quot;linecomment&quot; state
	&quot;linecomment&quot;: {
		&quot;\n&quot;: &quot;source&quot;,
		&quot;@licen[cs]e\\s(.*)&quot;: function(match, licenseText) {
			this.licences.push(licenseText.trim());
		}
	}
});

var licences = parser.parse(&quot;source&quot;, sourceCode, { licences: [] }).licences;

console.log(licences);
```

&gt; Find the first file matching a given pattern in the current directory or the nearest ancestor directory.

Matching is done with [micromatch][], please report any matching related issues on that repository. 

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i findup-sync --save
```

## Usage

```js
var findup = require('findup-sync');
findup(patternOrPatterns [, micromatchOptions]);

// Start looking in the CWD.
var filepath1 = findup('{a,b}*.txt');

// Start looking somewhere else, and ignore case (probably a good idea).
var filepath2 = findup('{a,b}*.txt', {cwd: '/some/path', nocase: true});
```

* `patterns` **{String|Array}**: Glob pattern(s) or file path(s) to match against.    
* `options` **{Object}**: Options to pass to [micromatch]. Note that if you want to start in a different directory than the current working directory, specify a `cwd` property here.    
* `returns` **{String}**: Returns the first matching file.

&gt; Transform the first chunk in a stream

Useful if you want to do something to the first chunk.

You can also set the minimum size of that chunk.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save first-chunk-stream
```


## Usage

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var concat = require('concat-stream');
var firstChunk = require('first-chunk-stream');

// unicorn.txt =&gt; unicorn rainbow
// `highWaterMark: 1` means it will only read 1 byte at the time
fs.createReadStream('unicorn.txt', {highWaterMark: 1})
	.pipe(firstChunk({minSize: 7}, function (chunk, enc, cb) {
		this.push(chunk.toUpperCase());
		cb();
	}))
	.pipe(concat(function (data) {
		console.log(data);
		//=&gt; UNICORN rainbow
	}));
```


## API

### firstChunk([options], transform)

#### options.minSize

Type: `number`

The minimum size of the first chunk.

#### transform(chunk, encoding, callback)

*Required*  
Type: `function`

The [function](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_transform_transform_chunk_encoding_callback) that gets the first chunk.

### firstChunk.ctor()

Instead of returning a [stream.Transform](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform_1) instance, `firstChunk.ctor()` returns a constructor for a custom Transform. This is useful when you want to use the same transform logic in multiple instances.

This package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.

# What is Flow

See [flowtype.org](http://flowtype.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).

# What is the Flow Parser

The Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.

# Usage

You can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do

```JavaScript
require('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});
```

To use in the browser, you can add

```HTML
&lt;script src=&quot;flow_parser.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

which will make the `flow` object available to use like so:

```JavaScript
flow.parse('1+1', {});
```

## Options

The second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:

* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators
* `esproposal_class_instance_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class instance fields
* `esproposal_class_static_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class static fields
* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax
* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types</pre></section></details><details><summary>flush-write-stream@1.0.2</summary><section><h3>flush-write-stream@1.0.2</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A globbing fs.watch wrapper built from the best parts of other fine watch libs.  
Compatible with Node.js 0.10/0.8, Windows, OSX and Linux.

![gaze](http://dontkry.com/images/repos/gaze.png)

## Usage
Install the module with: `npm install gaze` or place into your `package.json`
and run `npm install`.

```javascript
var gaze = require('gaze');

// Watch all .js files/dirs in process.cwd()
gaze('**/*.js', function(err, watcher) {
  // Files have all started watching
  // watcher === this

  // Get all watched files
  console.log(this.watched());

  // On file changed
  this.on('changed', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was changed');
  });

  // On file added
  this.on('added', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was added');
  });

  // On file deleted
  this.on('deleted', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was deleted');
  });

  // On changed/added/deleted
  this.on('all', function(event, filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was ' + event);
  });

  // Get watched files with relative paths
  console.log(this.relative());
});

// Also accepts an array of patterns
gaze(['stylesheets/*.css', 'images/**/*.png'], function() {
  // Add more patterns later to be watched
  this.add(['js/*.js']);
});
```

### Alternate Interface

```javascript
var Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;

var gaze = new Gaze('**/*');

// Files have all started watching
gaze.on('ready', function(watcher) { });

// A file has been added/changed/deleted has occurred
gaze.on('all', function(event, filepath) { });
```

### Errors

```javascript

### Minimatch / Glob

See [isaacs's minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more
information on glob patterns.

## Documentation

### gaze(patterns, [options], callback)

* `patterns` {String|Array} File patterns to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* `callback` {Function}
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `watcher` {Object} Instance of the Gaze watcher

### Class: gaze.Gaze

Create a Gaze object by instanting the `gaze.Gaze` class.

```javascript
var Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;
var gaze = new Gaze(pattern, options, callback);
```

#### Properties

* `options` The options object passed in.
  * `interval` {integer} Interval to pass to fs.watchFile
  * `debounceDelay` {integer} Delay for events called in succession for the same
    file/event

#### Events

* `ready(watcher)` When files have been globbed and watching has begun.
* `all(event, filepath)` When an `added`, `changed` or `deleted` event occurs.
* `added(filepath)` When a file has been added to a watch directory.
* `changed(filepath)` When a file has been changed.
* `deleted(filepath)` When a file has been deleted.
* `renamed(newPath, oldPath)` When a file has been renamed.
* `end()` When the watcher is closed and watches have been removed.
* `error(err)` When an error occurs.
* `nomatch` When no files have been matched.

#### Methods

* `emit(event, [...])` Wrapper for the EventEmitter.emit.
  `added`|`changed`|`deleted` events will also trigger the `all` event.
* `close()` Unwatch all files and reset the watch instance.
* `add(patterns, callback)` Adds file(s) patterns to be watched.
* `remove(filepath)` removes a file or directory from being watched. Does not
  recurse directories.
* `watched()` Returns the currently watched files.
* `relative([dir, unixify])` Returns the currently watched files with relative paths.
  * `dir` {string} Only return relative files for this directory.
  * `unixify` {boolean} Return paths with `/` instead of `\\` if on Windows.

## FAQs

### Why Another `fs.watch` Wrapper?
I liked parts of other `fs.watch` wrappers but none had all the features I
needed. This lib combines the features I needed from other fine watch libs:
Speedy data behavior from
[paulmillr's chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar), API interface
from [mikeal's watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch) and file globbing using
[isaacs's glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) which is also used by
[cowboy's Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).

### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?
This is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is
very low (256). Increase your limit temporarily with `ulimit -n 10480`, the
number being the new max limit.

A globbing fs.watch wrapper built from the best parts of other fine watch libs.  
Compatible with Node.js 4.x/0.12/0.10, Windows, OSX and Linux.

![gaze](http://dontkry.com/images/repos/gaze.png)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gaze.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gaze/)

## Usage
Install the module with: `npm install gaze` or place into your `package.json`
and run `npm install`.

```javascript
var gaze = require('gaze');

// Watch all .js files/dirs in process.cwd()
gaze('**/*.js', function(err, watcher) {
  // Files have all started watching
  // watcher === this

  // Get all watched files
  var watched = this.watched();

  // On file changed
  this.on('changed', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was changed');
  });

  // On file added
  this.on('added', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was added');
  });

  // On file deleted
  this.on('deleted', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was deleted');
  });

  // On changed/added/deleted
  this.on('all', function(event, filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was ' + event);
  });

  // Get watched files with relative paths
  var files = this.relative();
});

// Also accepts an array of patterns
gaze(['stylesheets/*.css', 'images/**/*.png'], function() {
  // Add more patterns later to be watched
  this.add(['js/*.js']);
});
```

### Alternate Interface

```javascript
var Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;

var gaze = new Gaze('**/*');

// Files have all started watching
gaze.on('ready', function(watcher) { });

// A file has been added/changed/deleted has occurred
gaze.on('all', function(event, filepath) { });
```

### Errors

```javascript
gaze('**/*', function(error, watcher) {
  if (error) {
    // Handle error if it occurred while starting up
  }
});

// Or with the alternative interface
var gaze = new Gaze();
gaze.on('error', function(error) {
  // Handle error here
});
gaze.add('**/*');
```

Module that helps you write generated functions in Node

```
npm install generate-function
```

[![build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/mafintosh/generate-function.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/generate-function)

## Disclamer

Writing code that generates code is hard.
You should only use this if you really, really, really need this for performance reasons (like schema validators / parsers etc).

## Usage

``` js
var genfun = require('generate-function')

var addNumber = function(val) {
  var fn = genfun()
    ('function add(n) {')
      ('return n + %d', val) // supports format strings to insert values
    ('}')

  return fn.toFunction() // will compile the function
}

var add2 = addNumber(2)

console.log('1+2=', add2(1))
console.log(add2.toString()) // prints the generated function
```

If you need to close over variables in your generated function pass them to `toFunction(scope)`

``` js
var multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b
}

var addAndMultiplyNumber = function(val) {
  var fn = genfun()
    ('function(n) {')
      ('if (typeof n !== &quot;number&quot;) {') // ending a line with { will indent the source
        ('throw new Error(&quot;argument should be a number&quot;)')
      ('}')
      ('var result = multiply(%d, n+%d)', val, val)
      ('return result')
    ('}')

  // use fn.toString() if you want to see the generated source

  return fn.toFunction({
    multiply: multiply
  })
}

var addAndMultiply2 = addAndMultiplyNumber(2)

console.log('(3 + 2) * 2 =', addAndMultiply2(3))
```

var files = glob.sync([
  'files/**',      //include all     files/
  '!files/x/**',   //then, exclude   files/x/
  'files/x/z.txt'  //then, reinclude files/x/z.txt
]);

console.log(files);
```

Resulting in:
```
[ 'files',
  'files/a.txt',
  'files/b.txt',
  'files/c.txt',
  'files/x/z.txt' ]
```

### CLI Usage

`npm install -g glob-all`

List all JavaScript files in `example/`

```
$ glob-all 'example/**/*.js'
example/async.js
example/events.js
example/order.js
example/perf.js
example/sync.js
```

Or list all JavaScript files but ignore 3rd-party modules:

```
$ glob-all '**/*.js' '!node_modules/**/*'
```

### API

* Async - `glob(patterns[, options], callback)`
  * Returns a `GlobAll` instance which emits:
    * `match`
    * `error`
    * `end`

* Sync - `glob.sync(patterns[, options])`
  * Returns `[String]` or `null`

See [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)

### Notes

#### Exclude Pattern

Since [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) only allows one pattern, there is no such thing as an exclude pattern (like in Grunt and Gulp). However, in `node-glob-all` we allow exclusion of the results of an entire pattern by prefixing the pattern with `!`.

[node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) exclusions (`!` inside the pattern) to exclude a portion of the path will still work as expected.

#### File Order

If a file occurs in more than once in the set, the one with the **more precise pattern** will be used and the other will be thrown away. So, if you'd like a file be in a certain position, you could do:

``` js
var glob = require('glob-all');

var files = glob.sync([
  'files/x/y.txt',
  'files/**'
]);

console.log(files);
```

Which will bring `files/x/y.txt` to the top:

```
[ 'files/x/y.txt',
  'files',
  'files/a.txt',
  'files/b.txt',
  'files/c.txt',
  'files/x',
  'files/x/z.txt' ]
```

#### Filtering out directories

You can use the `mark` option to mark directories with a `/`, then you can:
``` js
files.filter(function(f) { return !/\/$/.test(f); });
```

#### Performance

Internally, `glob-all` uses the `statCache` option to prevent repeat lookups across multiple patterns.

#### Todo

* Implement `abort()`
* Add tests

#### Contributing

* edit `glob-all.js`
* `npm test`

An easy-to-use wildcard globbing library.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install globule`

```javascript
var globule = require('globule');
var filepaths = globule.find('**/*.js');
```

## Documentation

### globule.find
Returns a unique array of all file or directory paths that match the given globbing pattern(s). This method accepts either comma separated globbing patterns or an array of globbing patterns. Paths matching patterns that begin with `!` will be excluded from the returned array. Patterns are processed in order, so inclusion and exclusion order is significant.

```js
globule.find(patterns [, options])
```

The `options` object supports all [glob][] library options, along with a few extras. These are the most commonly used:

* `filter` Either a valid [fs.Stats method name](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) or a function that will be passed the matched `src` filepath and `options` object as arguments. This function should return a `Boolean` value.
* `nonull` Retain globbing patterns in result set even if they fail to match files.
* `matchBase` Patterns without slashes will match just the basename part. Eg. this makes `*.js` work like `**/*.js`.
* `srcBase` Patterns will be matched relative to the specified path instead of the current working directory. This is a synonym for `cwd`.
* `prefixBase` Any specified `srcBase` will be prefixed to all returned filepaths.

[glob]: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob

### globule.match
Match one or more globbing patterns against one or more file paths. Returns a uniqued array of all file paths that match any of the specified globbing patterns. Both the `patterns` and `filepaths` arguments can be a single string or array of strings. Paths matching patterns that begin with `!` will be excluded from the returned array. Patterns are processed in order, so inclusion and exclusion order is significant.

```js
grunt.file.match(patterns, filepaths [, options])
```

### globule.isMatch
This method contains the same signature and logic as the `globule.match` method, but returns `true` if any files were matched, otherwise `false`.

```js
grunt.file.isMatch(patterns, filepaths [, options])
```

### globule.mapping
Given a set of source file paths, returns an array of src-dest file mapping objects. Both src and dest paths may be renamed, depending on the options specified.

```js
globule.mapping(filepaths [, options])
```

In addition to the options the `globule.find` method supports, the options object also supports these properties:

* `srcBase` The directory from which patterns are matched. Any string specified as `srcBase` is effectively stripped from the beginning of all matched paths.
* `destBase` The specified path is prefixed to all `dest` filepaths.
* `ext` Remove anything after (and including) the first `.` in the destination path, then append this value.
* `extDot` Change the behavior of `ext`, `&quot;first&quot;` and `&quot;last&quot;` will remove anything after the first or last `.` in the destination filename, respectively. Defaults to `&quot;first&quot;`.
* `flatten` Remove the path component from all matched src files. The src file path is still joined to the specified destBase.
* `rename` If specified, this function will be responsible for returning the final `dest` filepath. By default, it flattens paths (if specified), changes extensions (if specified) and joins the matched path to the `destBase`.

### globule.findMapping
This method is a convenience wrapper around the `globule.find` and `globule.mapping` methods.

```js
globule.findMapping(patterns [, options])
```


## Examples

Given the files `foo/a.js` and `foo/b.js`:

### srcBase and destBase

```js
globule.find(&quot;foo/*.js&quot;)
// [&quot;foo/a.js&quot;, &quot;foo/b.js&quot;]

globule.find(&quot;*.js&quot;, {srcBase: &quot;foo&quot;})
// [&quot;a.js&quot;, &quot;b.js&quot;]

globule.find(&quot;*.js&quot;, {srcBase: &quot;foo&quot;, prefixBase: true})
// [&quot;foo/a.js&quot;, &quot;foo/b.js&quot;]
```

GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick for node

## Bug Reports

When reporting bugs please include the version of graphicsmagick/imagemagick you're using (gm -version/convert -version) as well as the version of this module and copies of any images you're having problems with.

## Getting started
First download and install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) or [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/). In Mac OS X, you can simply use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and do:

    brew install imagemagick
    brew install graphicsmagick

If you want WebP support with ImageMagick, you must add the WebP option:

    brew install imagemagick --with-webp

then either use npm:

    npm install gm

or clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/aheckmann/gm.git


## Use ImageMagick instead of gm

Subclass `gm` to enable ImageMagick

```js
var fs = require('fs')
  , gm = require('gm').subClass({imageMagick: true});

// resize and remove EXIF profile data
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resize(240, 240)
...
```


## Basic Usage

```js
var fs = require('fs')
  , gm = require('gm');

// resize and remove EXIF profile data
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resize(240, 240)
.noProfile()
.write('/path/to/resize.png', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});

// some files would not be resized appropriately
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5870466/imagemagick-incorrect-dimensions
// you have two options:
// use the '!' flag to ignore aspect ratio
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resize(240, 240, '!')
.write('/path/to/resize.png', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});

// use the .resizeExact with only width and/or height arguments
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resizeExact(240, 240)
.write('/path/to/resize.png', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});

// obtain the size of an image
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.size(function (err, size) {
  if (!err)
    console.log(size.width &gt; size.height ? 'wider' : 'taller than you');
});

// output all available image properties
gm('/path/to/img.png')
.identify(function (err, data) {
  if (!err) console.log(data)
});

// pull out the first frame of an animated gif and save as png
gm('/path/to/animated.gif[0]')
.write('/path/to/firstframe.png', function (err) {
  if (err) console.log('aaw, shucks');
});

// auto-orient an image
gm('/path/to/img.jpg')
.autoOrient()
.write('/path/to/oriented.jpg', function (err) {
  if (err) ...
})

// crazytown
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.flip()
.magnify()
.rotate('green', 45)
.blur(7, 3)
.crop(300, 300, 150, 130)
.edge(3)
.write('/path/to/crazy.jpg', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('crazytown has arrived');
})

// annotate an image
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.stroke(&quot;#ffffff&quot;)
.drawCircle(10, 10, 20, 10)
.font(&quot;Helvetica.ttf&quot;, 12)
.drawText(30, 20, &quot;GMagick!&quot;)
.write(&quot;/path/to/drawing.png&quot;, function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});

// creating an image
gm(200, 400, &quot;#ddff99f3&quot;)
.drawText(10, 50, &quot;from scratch&quot;)
.write(&quot;/path/to/brandNewImg.jpg&quot;, function (err) {
  // ...
});
```

## Streams

```js
// passing a stream
var readStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/my/img.jpg');
gm(readStream, 'img.jpg')
.write('/path/to/reformat.png', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});


// passing a downloadable image by url

var request = require('request');
var url = &quot;www.abc.com/pic.jpg&quot;

gm(request(url))
.write('/path/to/reformat.png', function (err) {
  if (!err) console.log('done');
});


// can also stream output to a ReadableStream
// (can be piped to a local file or remote server)
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resize('200', '200')
.stream(function (err, stdout, stderr) {
  var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/my/resized.jpg');
  stdout.pipe(writeStream);
});

// without a callback, .stream() returns a stream
// this is just a convenience wrapper for above.
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/my/resized.jpg');
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.resize('200', '200')
.stream()
.pipe(writeStream);

// pass a format or filename to stream() and
// gm will provide image data in that format
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.stream('png', function (err, stdout, stderr) {
  var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/my/reformatted.png');
  stdout.pipe(writeStream);
});

// or without the callback
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/my/reformatted.png');
gm('/path/to/my/img.jpg')
.stream('png')
.pipe(writeStream);

// combine the two for true streaming image processing
var readStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/my/img.jpg');
gm(readStream)
.resize('200', '200')
.stream(function (err, stdout, stderr) {
  var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/my/resized.jpg');
  stdout.pipe(writeStream);
});

// GOTCHA:
// when working with input streams and any 'identify'
// operation (size, format, etc), you must pass &quot;{bufferStream: true}&quot; if
// you also need to convert (write() or stream()) the image afterwards
// NOTE: this buffers the readStream in memory!
var readStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/my/img.jpg');
gm(readStream)
.size({bufferStream: true}, function(err, size) {
  this.resize(size.width / 2, size.height / 2)
  this.write('/path/to/resized.jpg', function (err) {
    if (!err) console.log('done');
  });
});

```

## Buffers

```js
// A buffer can be passed instead of a filepath as well
var buf = require('fs').readFileSync('/path/to/image.jpg');

gm(buf, 'image.jpg')
.noise('laplacian')
.write('/path/to/out.jpg', function (err) {
  if (err) return handle(err);
  console.log('Created an image from a Buffer!');
});

/*
A buffer can also be returned instead of a stream
The first argument to toBuffer is optional, it specifies the image format
*/
gm('img.jpg')
.resize(100, 100)
.toBuffer('PNG',function (err, buffer) {
  if (err) return handle(err);
  console.log('done!');
})
```

## Custom Arguments

If `gm` does not supply you with a method you need or does not work as you'd like, you can simply use `gm().in()` or `gm().out()` to set your own arguments.

- `gm().command()` - Custom command such as `identify` or `convert`
- `gm().in()` - Custom input arguments
- `gm().out()` - Custom output arguments

The command will be formatted in the following order:

1. `command` - ie `convert`
2. `in` - the input arguments
3. `source` - stdin or an image file
4. `out` - the output arguments
5. `output` - stdout or the image file to write to

For example, suppose you want the following command:

```bash
gm &quot;convert&quot; &quot;label:Offline&quot; &quot;PNG:-&quot;
```

However, using `gm().label()` may not work as intended for you:

```js
gm()
.label('Offline')
.stream();
```

would yield:

```bash
gm &quot;convert&quot; &quot;-label&quot; &quot;\&quot;Offline\&quot;&quot; &quot;PNG:-&quot;
```

Instead, you can use `gm().out()`:

```js
gm()
.out('label:Offline')
.stream();
```

which correctly yields:

```bash
gm &quot;convert&quot; &quot;label:Offline&quot; &quot;PNG:-&quot;
```

### Custom Identify Format String

When identifying an image, you may want to use a custom formatting string instead of using `-verbose`, which is quite slow.
You can use your own [formatting string](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/escape.php) when using `gm().identify(format, callback)`.
For example,

```js
gm('img.png').format(function (err, format) {

})

// is equivalent to

gm('img.png').identify('%m', function (err, format) {

})
```

since `%m` is the format option for getting the image file format.

## Platform differences

Please document and refer to any [platform or ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick issues/differences here](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm/wiki/GraphicsMagick-and-ImageMagick-versions).

## Examples:

  Check out the [examples](http://github.com/aheckmann/gm/tree/master/examples/) directory to play around.
  Also take a look at the [extending gm](http://wiki.github.com/aheckmann/gm/extending-gm)
  page to see how to customize gm to your own needs.

## Constructor:

  There are a few ways you can use the `gm` image constructor.

  - 1) `gm(path)` When you pass a string as the first argument it is interpreted as the path to an image you intend to manipulate.
  - 2) `gm(stream || buffer, [filename])` You may also pass a ReadableStream or Buffer as the first argument, with an optional file name for format inference.
  - 3) `gm(width, height, [color])` When you pass two integer arguments, gm will create a new image on the fly with the provided dimensions and an optional background color. And you can still chain just like you do with pre-existing images too. See [here](http://github.com/aheckmann/gm/blob/master/examples/new.js) for an example.

The links below refer to an older version of gm but everything should still work, if anyone feels like updating them please make a PR

  - image output
    - **write** - writes the processed image data to the specified filename
    - **stream** - provides a `ReadableStream` with the processed image data
    - **toBuffer** - returns the image as a `Buffer` instead of a stream

##compare

Graphicsmagicks `compare` command is exposed through `gm.compare()`. This allows us to determine if two images can be considered &quot;equal&quot;.

Currently `gm.compare` only accepts file paths.

    gm.compare(path1, path2 [, options], callback)

```js
gm.compare('/path/to/image1.jpg', '/path/to/another.png', function (err, isEqual, equality, raw, path1, path2) {
  if (err) return handle(err);

  // if the images were considered equal, `isEqual` will be true, otherwise, false.
  console.log('The images were equal: %s', isEqual);

  // to see the total equality returned by graphicsmagick we can inspect the `equality` argument.
  console.log('Actual equality: %d', equality);

  // inspect the raw output
  console.log(raw);

  // print file paths
  console.log(path1, path2);
})
```

You may wish to pass a custom tolerance threshold to increase or decrease the default level of `0.4`.


```js
gm.compare('/path/to/image1.jpg', '/path/to/another.png', 1.2, function (err, isEqual) {
  ...
})
```

To output a diff image, pass a configuration object to define the diff options and tolerance.


```js
var options = {
  file: '/path/to/diff.png',
  highlightColor: 'yellow',
  tolerance: 0.02
}
gm.compare('/path/to/image1.jpg', '/path/to/another.png', options, function (err, isEqual, equality, raw) {
  ...
})
```

##composite

GraphicsMagick supports compositing one image on top of another. This is exposed through `gm.composite()`. Its first argument is an image path with the changes to the base image, and an optional mask image.

Currently, `gm.composite()` only accepts file paths.

    gm.composite(other [, mask])

```js
gm('/path/to/image.jpg')
.composite('/path/to/second_image.jpg')
.geometry('+100+150')
.write('/path/to/composite.png', function(err) {
    if(!err) console.log(&quot;Written composite image.&quot;);
});
```

##montage

GraphicsMagick supports montage for combining images side by side. This is exposed through `gm.montage()`. Its only argument is an image path with the changes to the base image.

Currently, `gm.montage()` only accepts file paths.

    gm.montage(other)

```js
gm('/path/to/image.jpg')
.montage('/path/to/second_image.jpg')
.geometry('+100+150')
.write('/path/to/montage.png', function(err) {
    if(!err) console.log(&quot;Written montage image.&quot;);
});
```

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

==============

In memory queue system prioritizing tasks.


Documentation
=============

Installation
-------------

``` bash
$ npm install --save grouped-queue
```

Methods
------------

### Constructor

The constructor takes an optional array of task groups. The first `String` name will be the first queue to be emptied, the second string will be the second group emptied, etc.

By default, the constructor will always add a `default` queue in the last position. You can overwrite the position of the `default` group if you specify it explicitly.

``` javascript
var Queue = require('grouped-queue');

var queue = new Queue([ 'first', 'second', 'third' ]);
```

### Queue#add `add( [group], task, [options] )`

Add a task into a group queue. If no group name is specified, `default` will be used.

Implicitly, each time you add a task, the queue will start emptying (if not already running).

Each task function is passed a callback function. This callback must be called when the task is complete.

``` javascript
queue.add(function( cb ) {
  DB.fetch().then( cb );
});
```

#### Option: `once`

You can register tasks in queues that will be dropped if they're already planned. This is done with the `once` option. You pass a String (basically a name) to the `once` option.

``` javascript
// This one will eventually run
queue.add( method, { once: &quot;readDB&quot; });

// This one will be dropped as `method` is currently in the queue
queue.add( method3, { once: &quot;readDB&quot; });
```

#### Option: `run`

You can register a task without launching the run loop by passing the argument `run: false`.

```javascript
queue.add( method, { run: false });
```

### Pro tip

Bind your tasks with context and arguments!

``` javascript
var task = function( models, cb ) {
  /* you get `models` data here! */
};
queue.add( task.bind(null, models) );
```

### That's all?

Yes!

Events
-------------

### `end`

This event is called **each time** the queue emptied itself.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl)

Growl support for Nodejs. This is essentially a port of my [Ruby Growl Library](http://github.com/visionmedia/growl). Ubuntu/Linux support added thanks to [@niftylettuce](http://github.com/niftylettuce).

## Installation

### Install

### Mac OS X (Darwin):

  Install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify). On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). To install:

    $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Ubuntu (Linux):

  Install `notify-send` through the [libnotify-bin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libnotify-bin) package:

    $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Windows:

  Download and install [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/default.aspx)

  Download [growlnotify](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/growlnotify.aspx) - **IMPORTANT :** Unpack growlnotify to a folder that is present in your path!

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

## Examples

Callback functions are optional

```javascript
var growl = require('growl')
growl('You have mail!')
growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true })
growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'})
growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
  // ... notified
})
```

## Options

  - title
    - notification title
  - name
    - application name
  - priority
    - priority for the notification (default is 0)
  - sticky
    - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed
  - image
    - Auto-detects the context:
      - path to an icon sets --iconpath
      - path to an image sets --image
      - capitalized word sets --appIcon
      - filename uses extname as --icon
      - otherwise treated as --icon
  - exec
    - manually specify a shell command instead
      - appends message to end of shell command
      - or, replaces `%s` with message
      - optionally prepends title (example: `title: message`)
      - examples: `{exec: 'tmux display-message'}`, `{exec: 'echo &quot;%s&quot; &gt; messages.log}`

gulp-rename is a [gulp](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp) plugin to rename files easily.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-rename.png?downloads=true&amp;downloadRank=true&amp;stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-rename/)

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hparra/gulp-rename.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hparra/gulp-rename)
[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/hparra/gulp-rename/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/hparra/gulp-rename#info=devDependencies)

## Usage

gulp-rename provides simple file renaming methods.

```javascript
var rename = require(&quot;gulp-rename&quot;);

// rename via string
gulp.src(&quot;./src/main/text/hello.txt&quot;)
  .pipe(rename(&quot;main/text/ciao/goodbye.md&quot;))
  .pipe(gulp.dest(&quot;./dist&quot;)); // ./dist/main/text/ciao/goodbye.md

// rename via function
gulp.src(&quot;./src/**/hello.txt&quot;)
  .pipe(rename(function (path) {
    path.dirname += &quot;/ciao&quot;;
    path.basename += &quot;-goodbye&quot;;
    path.extname = &quot;.md&quot;
  }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest(&quot;./dist&quot;)); // ./dist/main/text/ciao/hello-goodbye.md

// rename via hash
gulp.src(&quot;./src/main/text/hello.txt&quot;, { base: process.cwd() })
  .pipe(rename({
    dirname: &quot;main/text/ciao&quot;,
    basename: &quot;aloha&quot;,
    prefix: &quot;bonjour-&quot;,
    suffix: &quot;-hola&quot;,
    extname: &quot;.md&quot;
  }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest(&quot;./dist&quot;)); // ./dist/main/text/ciao/bonjour-aloha-hola.md
```

**See test/rename.spec.js for more examples and test/path-parsing.spec.js for hairy details.**

## Notes

* `dirname` is the relative path from the base directory set by `gulp.src` to the filename.
  * `gulp.src()` uses glob-stream which sets the base to the parent of the first directory glob (`*`, `**`, [], or extglob). `dirname` is the remaining directories or `./` if none. glob-stream versions &gt;= 3.1.0 (used by gulp &gt;= 3.2.2) accept a `base` option, which can be used to explicitly set the base.
  * `gulp.dest()` renames the directories between `process.cwd()` and `dirname` (i.e. the base relative to CWD). Use `dirname` to rename the directories matched by the glob or descendents of the base of option.
* `basename` is the filename without the extension like path.basename(filename, path.extname(filename)).
* `extname` is the file extension including the '.' like path.extname(filename).

===============
A gulp plugin for handling TypeScript compilation workflow. The plugin exposes TypeScript's compiler options to gulp using TypeScript API.

Updating from version 2? See the [breaking changes in version 3](http://dev.ivogabe.com/gulp-typescript-3/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivogabe/gulp-typescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivogabe/gulp-typescript)

Features
--------
- Incremental compilation (so faster builds)
- Error reporting
- Different output streams for .js, .d.ts files.
- Support for sourcemaps using gulp-sourcemaps
- Compile once, and filter different targets

How to install
--------------
##### 1. Install gulp CLI
```shell
npm install --global gulp-cli
```
##### 2. Install gulp in the project dependency
```shell
npm install gulp
```
##### 3. Install gulp-typescript &amp; TypeScript
```shell
npm install gulp-typescript typescript
```

Options
-------
Almost all options from TypeScript are supported.
- `outFile` (string) - Generate one javascript and one definition file. Only works when no module system is used.
- `outDir` (string) - Move output to a different (virtual) directory. Note that you still need `gulp.dest` to write output to disk.
- `noImplicitAny` (boolean) - Warn on expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type.
- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors` (boolean) - Suppress `--noImplicitAny` errors for indexing objects lacking index signatures.
- `noLib` (boolean) - Don't include the default lib (with definitions for - Array, Date etc)
- `lib` (string[]) - List of library files to be included in the compilation.
- `target` (string) - Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5' or 'ES6'.
- `module` (string) - Specify module code generation: 'commonjs', 'amd', 'umd' or 'system'.
- `jsx` (string) - Specify jsx code generation: 'react' or 'preserve' (TS1.6+).
- `declaration` (boolean) - Generates corresponding .d.ts files. You need to pipe the `dts` streams to save these files.
- `removeComments` (boolean) - Do not emit comments to output.
- `emitDecoratorMetadata` (boolean) - Emit design-time metadate for decorated declarations in source.
- `experimentalAsyncFunctions` (boolean) - Support for ES7-proposed asynchronous functions using the `async`/`await` keywords (TS1.6+).
- `experimentalDecorators` (boolean) - Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators.
- `moduleResolution` (string) - Determine how modules get resolved. Either 'node' for Node.js/io.js style resolution, or 'classic' (default) (TS1.6+).
- `noEmitOnError` (boolean) - Do not emit outputs if any type checking errors were reported.
- `noEmitHelpers` (boolean) - Do not generate custom helper functions like __extends in compiled output.
- `preserveConstEnums` (boolean) - Do not erase const enum declarations in generated code. 
- `isolatedModules` (boolean) - Compiles files seperately and doesn't check types, which causes a big speed increase. You have to use gulp-plumber and TypeScript 1.5+.
- `allowJs` (boolean) - Allow JavaScript files to be compiled.
- `rootDir` - Specifies the root directory of input files. Only use to control the output directory structure with `outDir`.

See the [TypeScript wiki](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for a complete list.
These options are not supported:
- Sourcemap options (`sourceMap`, `inlineSourceMap`, `inlineSources`, `sourceRoot`) - Use  [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) instead.
- `watch` - Use `gulp.watch` instead. See the paragraph &quot;Incremental compilation&quot;.
- `project` - See &quot;Using `tsconfig.json`&quot;.
- Obvious: `help`, `version`

Basic Usage
----------
Below is a minimal `gulpfile.js` which will compile all TypeScript file in folder `src` and emit a single output file called `output.js` in  `built/local`. To invoke, simple run `gulp`.

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var ts = require('gulp-typescript');

gulp.task('default', function () {
    return gulp.src('src/**/*.ts')
        .pipe(ts({
            noImplicitAny: true,
            outFile: 'output.js'
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('built/local'));
});
```
Another example of `gulpfile.js`. Instead of creating the default task, the file specifies custom named task. To invoke, run `gulp scripts` instead of `gulp`. As a result, the task will generate both JavaScript files and TypeScript definition files (`.d.ts`).
```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var ts = require('gulp-typescript');
var merge = require('merge2');  // Requires separate installation

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
    var tsResult = gulp.src('lib/**/*.ts')
        .pipe(ts({
            declaration: true
        }));

    return merge([
        tsResult.dts.pipe(gulp.dest('release/definitions')),
        tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('release/js'))
    ]);
});
```
`tsResult` is a stream containing the generated JavaScript and definition files.
In many situations, some plugins need to be executed on the JavaScript files.
For these situations, the stream has sub-streams, namely a JavaScript stream (`tsResult.js`) and a definition file stream (`tsResult.dts`). 
You need to set the `declaration` option to generate definition files.
If you don't need the definition files, you can use a configuration as seen in the first example.

Incremental compilation
-----------------------
Instead of calling `ts(options)`, you can create a project first, and then call `tsProject()`. An example:
```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var ts = require('gulp-typescript');
var merge = require('merge2');

var tsProject = ts.createProject({
    declaration: true
});

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
    var tsResult = gulp.src('lib/*.ts')
        .pipe(tsProject());

    return merge([ // Merge the two output streams, so this task is finished when the IO of both operations is done.
        tsResult.dts.pipe(gulp.dest('release/definitions')),
        tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('release/js'))
    ]);
});

gulp.task('watch', ['scripts'], function() {
    gulp.watch('lib/*.ts', ['scripts']);
});
```
When you run `gulp watch`, the source will be compiled as usual. Then, when you make a change and save the file, your TypeScript files will be compiled in about half the time.

You must create the project outside of the task. You can't use the same project in multiple tasks.
Instead, create multiple projects or use a single task to compile your sources.

Using `tsconfig.json`
-------------
To use `tsconfig.json`, you have to use `ts.createProject`:
```javascript
var tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json');
```
If you want to add or overwrite certain settings in the `tsconfig.json` file, you can use:
```javascript
var tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json', { noImplicitAny: true });
```
The task will look like:
```javascript
gulp.task('scripts', function() {
    var tsResult = gulp.src(&quot;lib/**/*.ts&quot;) // or tsProject.src()
        .pipe(tsProject());

    return tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('release'));
});
```

You can replace `gulp.src(...)` with `tsProject.src()` to load files based on the tsconfig file (based on `files`, `excludes` and `includes`).

TypeScript version
------------------
gulp-typescript isn't restricted to a single TypeScript version.
You can install the latest stable version using `npm install typescript --save-dev` or a nightly `npm install typescript@next --save-dev`.

You can also use a fork of TypeScript, if it is based on TypeScript 2.x. You can configure this in your gulpfile:
```javascript
[...].pipe(ts({
    typescript: require('my-fork-of-typescript')
}));
```
Or in combination with a `tsconfig` file:
```javascript
var tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json', {
    typescript: require('my-form-of-typescript')
});
```

Source maps
----------
Example of ```gulpfile.js``` which will compile typescript to javascript as well as generate
associated sourcemap.

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp')
var ts = require('gulp-typescript');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
    var tsResult = gulp.src('lib/*.ts')
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init()) // This means sourcemaps will be generated
        .pipe(ts({
            // ...
        }));

    return tsResult.js
        .pipe( ... ) // You can use other plugins that also support gulp-sourcemaps
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write()) // Now the sourcemaps are added to the .js file
        .pipe(gulp.dest('release/js'));
});
```
For more information, see [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps).

Reporters
---------
You can specify a custom reporter as the second argument of the main function, or as the only argument when using a `tsProject`:
```javascript
ts(options, reporter);
tsProject(reporter);
```
Available reporters are:
- nullReporter (`ts.reporter.nullReporter()`) - Don't report errors
- defaultReporter (`ts.reporter.defaultReporter()`) - Report basic errors to the console
- longReporter (`ts.reporter.longReporter()`) - Extended version of default reporter, intelliJ link functionality + file watcher error highlighting should work using this one
- fullReporter (`ts.reporter.fullReporter(showFullFilename?: boolean)`) - Show full error messages, with source.

If you want to build a custom reporter, you take a look at `lib/reporter.ts`, that file declares an interface which a reporter should implement.

Build gulp-typescript
------------

1. Clone this repo
2. Execute `npm install`
3. Execute `git submodule update --init` to pull down the TypeScript compiler/services versions used in the test suite.
4. Ensure the gulp CLI is globally installed (`npm install -g gulp-cli`).
5. Execute the tests: `gulp`.

The plugin uses itself to compile. There are 2 build directories, ```release``` and ```release-2```. ```release``` must always contain a working build. ```release-2``` contains the last build. When you run ```gulp compile```, the build will be saved in the ```release-2``` directory. ```gulp test``` will compile the source to ```release-2```, and then it will run some tests. If these tests give no errors, you can run ```gulp release```. The contents from ```release-2``` will be copied to ```release```.

_he_ (for “HTML entities”) is a robust HTML entity encoder/decoder written in JavaScript. It supports [all standardized named character references as per HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#named-character-references), handles [ambiguous ampersands](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/ambiguous-ampersands) and other edge cases [just like a browser would](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#tokenizing-character-references), has an extensive test suite, and — contrary to many other JavaScript solutions — _he_ handles astral Unicode symbols just fine. [An online demo is available.](https://mothereff.in/html-entities)

## Installation

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install he
```

Via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install he
```

Via [Component](https://github.com/component/component):

```bash
component install mathiasbynens/he
```

In a browser:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;he.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [io.js](https://iojs.org/), [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var he = require('he');
```

In [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):

```js
load('he.js');
```

Using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):

```js
require(
  {
    'paths': {
      'he': 'path/to/he'
    }
  },
  ['he'],
  function(he) {
    console.log(he);
  }
);
```

## API

### `he.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

### `he.encode(text, options)`

This function takes a string of text and encodes (by default) any symbols that aren’t printable ASCII symbols and `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `'`, and `` ` ``, replacing them with character references.

```js
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux');
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'
```

As long as the input string contains [allowed code points](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream) only, the return value of this function is always valid HTML. Any [(invalid) code points that cannot be represented using a character reference](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#table-charref-overrides) in the input are not encoded:

```js
he.encode('foo \0 bar');
// → 'foo \0 bar'
```

However, enabling [the `strict` option](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he#strict) causes invalid code points to throw an exception. With `strict` enabled, `he.encode` either throws (if the input contains invalid code points) or returns a string of valid HTML.

The `options` object is optional. It recognizes the following properties:

#### `useNamedReferences`

The default value for the `useNamedReferences` option is `false`. This means that `encode()` will not use any named character references (e.g. `&amp;copy;`) in the output — hexadecimal escapes (e.g. `&amp;#xA9;`) will be used instead. Set it to `true` to enable the use of named references.

**Note that if compatibility with older browsers is a concern, this option should remain disabled.**

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`):
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux');
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly disallow named references:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'useNamedReferences': false
});
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly allow named references:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'useNamedReferences': true
});
// → 'foo &amp;copy; bar &amp;ne; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'
```

#### `decimal`

The default value for the `decimal` option is `false`. If the option is enabled, `encode` will generally use decimal escapes (e.g. `&amp;#169;`) rather than hexadecimal escapes (e.g. `&amp;#xA9;`). Beside of this replacement, the basic behavior remains the same when combined with other options. For example: if both options `useNamedReferences` and `decimal` are enabled, named references (e.g. `&amp;copy;`) are used over decimal escapes. HTML entities without a named reference are encoded using decimal escapes.

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`):
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux');
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly disable decimal escapes:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'decimal': false
});
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable decimal escapes:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'decimal': true
});
// → 'foo &amp;#169; bar &amp;#8800; baz &amp;#119558; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly allow named references and decimal escapes:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'useNamedReferences': true,
  'decimal': true
});
// → 'foo &amp;copy; bar &amp;ne; baz &amp;#119558; qux'
```

#### `encodeEverything`

The default value for the `encodeEverything` option is `false`. This means that `encode()` will not use any character references for printable ASCII symbols that don’t need escaping. Set it to `true` to encode every symbol in the input string. When set to `true`, this option takes precedence over `allowUnsafeSymbols` (i.e. setting the latter to `true` in such a case has no effect).

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`):
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux');
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; bar &amp;#x2260; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly encode all symbols:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'encodeEverything': true
});
// → '&amp;#x66;&amp;#x6F;&amp;#x6F;&amp;#x20;&amp;#xA9;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x2260;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x7A;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x1D306;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x71;&amp;#x75;&amp;#x78;'

// This setting can be combined with the `useNamedReferences` option:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {
  'encodeEverything': true,
  'useNamedReferences': true
});
// → '&amp;#x66;&amp;#x6F;&amp;#x6F;&amp;#x20;&amp;copy;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x20;&amp;ne;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x7A;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x1D306;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x71;&amp;#x75;&amp;#x78;'
```

#### `strict`

The default value for the `strict` option is `false`. This means that `encode()` will encode any HTML text content you feed it, even if it contains any symbols that cause [parse errors](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream). To throw an error when such invalid HTML is encountered, set the `strict` option to `true`. This option makes it possible to use _he_ as part of HTML parsers and HTML validators.

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. error-tolerant mode):
he.encode('\x01');
// → '&amp;#x1;'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable error-tolerant mode:
he.encode('\x01', {
  'strict': false
});
// → '&amp;#x1;'

// Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable strict mode:
he.encode('\x01', {
  'strict': true
});
// → Parse error
```

#### `allowUnsafeSymbols`

The default value for the `allowUnsafeSymbols` option is `false`. This means that characters that are unsafe for use in HTML content (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `'`, and `` ` ``) will be encoded. When set to `true`, only non-ASCII characters will be encoded. If the `encodeEverything` option is set to `true`, this option will be ignored.

```js
he.encode('foo © and &amp; ampersand', {
  'allowUnsafeSymbols': true
});
// → 'foo &amp;#xA9; and &amp; ampersand'
```

#### Overriding default `encode` options globally

The global default setting can be overridden by modifying the `he.encode.options` object. This saves you from passing in an `options` object for every call to `encode` if you want to use the non-default setting.

```js
// Read the global default setting:
he.encode.options.useNamedReferences;
// → `false` by default

// Override the global default setting:
he.encode.options.useNamedReferences = true;

// Using the global default setting, which is now `true`:
he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux');
// → 'foo &amp;copy; bar &amp;ne; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux'
```

### `he.decode(html, options)`

This function takes a string of HTML and decodes any named and numerical character references in it using [the algorithm described in section 12.2.4.69 of the HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#tokenizing-character-references).

```js
he.decode('foo &amp;copy; bar &amp;ne; baz &amp;#x1D306; qux');
// → 'foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'
```

The `options` object is optional. It recognizes the following properties:

#### `isAttributeValue`

The default value for the `isAttributeValue` option is `false`. This means that `decode()` will decode the string as if it were used in [a text context in an HTML document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#data-state). HTML has different rules for [parsing character references in attribute values](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-reference-in-attribute-value-state) — set this option to `true` to treat the input string as if it were used as an attribute value.

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. HTML text context):
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar');
// → 'foo&amp;bar'

// Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly assume an HTML text context:
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar', {
  'isAttributeValue': false
});
// → 'foo&amp;bar'

// Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly assume an HTML attribute value context:
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar', {
  'isAttributeValue': true
});
// → 'foo&amp;ampbar'
```

#### `strict`

The default value for the `strict` option is `false`. This means that `decode()` will decode any HTML text content you feed it, even if it contains any entities that cause [parse errors](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#tokenizing-character-references). To throw an error when such invalid HTML is encountered, set the `strict` option to `true`. This option makes it possible to use _he_ as part of HTML parsers and HTML validators.

```js
// Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. error-tolerant mode):
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar');
// → 'foo&amp;bar'

// Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly enable error-tolerant mode:
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar', {
  'strict': false
});
// → 'foo&amp;bar'

// Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly enable strict mode:
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar', {
  'strict': true
});
// → Parse error
```

#### Overriding default `decode` options globally

The global default settings for the `decode` function can be overridden by modifying the `he.decode.options` object. This saves you from passing in an `options` object for every call to `decode` if you want to use a non-default setting.

```js
// Read the global default setting:
he.decode.options.isAttributeValue;
// → `false` by default

// Override the global default setting:
he.decode.options.isAttributeValue = true;

// Using the global default setting, which is now `true`:
he.decode('foo&amp;ampbar');
// → 'foo&amp;ampbar'
```

### `he.escape(text)`

This function takes a string of text and escapes it for use in text contexts in XML or HTML documents. Only the following characters are escaped: `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `'`, and `` ` ``.

```js
he.escape('&lt;img src=\'x\' onerror=&quot;prompt(1)&quot;&gt;');
// → '&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#x27;x&amp;#x27; onerror=&amp;quot;prompt(1)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;'
```

### `he.unescape(html, options)`

`he.unescape` is an alias for `he.decode`. It takes a string of HTML and decodes any named and numerical character references in it.

### Using the `he` binary

To use the `he` binary in your shell, simply install _he_ globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g he
```

After that you will be able to encode/decode HTML entities from the command line:

```bash
$ he --encode 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz'
f&amp;#xF6;o &amp;#x2665; b&amp;#xE5;r &amp;#x1D306; baz

$ he --encode --use-named-refs 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz'
f&amp;ouml;o &amp;hearts; b&amp;aring;r &amp;#x1D306; baz

$ he --decode 'f&amp;ouml;o &amp;hearts; b&amp;aring;r &amp;#x1D306; baz'
föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz
```

Read a local text file, encode it for use in an HTML text context, and save the result to a new file:

```bash
$ he --encode &lt; foo.txt &gt; foo-escaped.html
```

Or do the same with an online text file:

```bash
$ curl -sL &quot;http://git.io/HnfEaw&quot; | he --encode &gt; escaped.html
```

Or, the opposite — read a local file containing a snippet of HTML in a text context, decode it back to plain text, and save the result to a new file:

```bash
$ he --decode &lt; foo-escaped.html &gt; foo.txt
```

Or do the same with an online HTML snippet:

```bash
$ curl -sL &quot;http://git.io/HnfEaw&quot; | he --decode &gt; decoded.txt
```

See `he --help` for the full list of options.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics)

`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches. It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.

## Usage

Cacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.

```js
const policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);

if (!policy.storable()) {
    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all
    return;
}

// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache
// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))
letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(request.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());
```

```js
// And later, when you receive a new request:
const {policy, response} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:
if (policy &amp;&amp; policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.
    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

It may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.

The key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.

### Constructor options

Request and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).

```js
const request = {
    url: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: '*/*',
    },
};

const response = {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',
    },
};

const options = {
    shared: true,
    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,
    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24*3600*1000, // 24h
    ignoreCargoCult: false,
};
```

If `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored).

`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100*0.1 = 10 days.

`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.

If `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's &quot;session limiter&quot; defaults.

### `storable()`

Returns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.

### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`

This is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.

If it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.

If it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).

### `responseHeaders()`

Returns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.

```js
cachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);
```

### `timeToLive()`

Returns approximate time in *milliseconds* until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).

After that time (when `timeToLive() &lt;= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.

### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`

Chances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.

### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)

When a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.

The following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.

#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`

Returns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.

Use this method when updating cache from the origin server.

```js
updateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);
```

#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`

Use this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:

* `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.
* `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.
   * If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body.
   * If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.

```js
// When serving requests from cache:
const {oldPolicy, oldResponse} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

if (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used
    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);

    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304
    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newResponse);

    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data
    const {policy, modified} = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(newRequest, newResponse);
    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;

    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response
    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(newRequest.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());

    // And proceed returning cached response as usual
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

```js
var ece = require('http_ece');
var crypto = require('crypto')
var base64 = require('base64url');

var parameters = {
  key: base64.encode(crypto.randomBytes(16)),
  salt: base64.encode(crypto.randomBytes(16))
};
var encrypted = ece.encrypt(data, parameters);

var decrypted = ece.encrypt(encrypted, parameters);

require('assert').equal(decrypted.compare(data), 0);
```

This also supports the static-ephemeral ECDH mode.  The source explains how.

# ICSS — Replace Symbols

Governs the way tokens are searched &amp; replaced during the linking stage of ICSS loading.

This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins (i.e. [CSS Modules Constants](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants))

## API

```js
import replaceSymbols from &quot;icss-replace-symbols&quot;
replaceSymbols(css, translations)
```

Where:

- `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with
- `translations` is an JS object of `symbol: &quot;replacement&quot;` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.

## Behaviour

A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:

- In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color`
- In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`

# ignore

`ignore` is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the .gitignore [spec](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.

##### Tested on

- Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`
- Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node &lt; `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.

Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.

## Table Of Main Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Guide for 2.x -&gt; 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- Related Packages
  - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.

## Usage

```js
const ignore = require('ignore')
const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])
```

### Filter the given paths

```js
const paths = [
  '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out
  '.abc/d/e.js'   // included
]

ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true
```

### As the filter function

```js
paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']
```

### Win32 paths will be handled

```js
ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js'])
// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
// ['.abc\\d\\e.js']
```

## Why another ignore?

- `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.

- `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
  - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
  - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.

- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
  - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.
  - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.
  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
  - Handle trailing whitespaces:
    - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).
    - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`
  - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.

## Methods

### .add(pattern)
### .add(patterns)

- **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance
- **patterns** `Array.&lt;pattern&gt;` Array of ignore patterns.

Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.

Returns `this`

Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.

```js
ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false
ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true
```

`pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:

```js
ignore()
.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
.filter(filenames)
```

`pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.

### &lt;strike&gt;.addIgnoreFile(path)&lt;/strike&gt;

REMOVED in `3.x` for now.

To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use

```js
const fs = require('fs')

if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
}
```

instead.


### .ignores(pathname)

&gt; new in 3.2.0

Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.

```js
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true
```

### .filter(paths)

Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.

- **paths** `Array.&lt;path&gt;` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.

**NOTICE** that:

- `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.

```js
// WRONG
ig.ignores('./abc')

// WRONG, for it will never happen.
// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
// `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.
// ```
// path.relative('/', '/abc')  -&gt; 'abc'
// ```
ig.ignores('/abc')

// Right
ig.ignores('abc')

// Right
ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -&gt; 'abc'
```

- In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.

Suppose the dir structure is:

```
/path/to/your/repo
    |-- a
    |   |-- a.js
    |
    |-- .b
    |
    |-- .c
         |-- .DS_store
```

Then the `paths` might be like this:

```js
[
  'a/a.js'
  '.b',
  '.c/.DS_store'
]
```

Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:

```js
const glob = require('glob')

glob('**', {
  // Adds a / character to directory matches.
  mark: true
}, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err)
  }

  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
  console.log(filtered)
})
```

### .createFilter()

Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.

Returns `function(path)` the filter function.

****

## Upgrade 2.x -&gt; 3.x

- All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
- `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
- `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.

****

## Contributing

The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.

So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.

==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
&lt;/script&gt;
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

## Goal and Philosophy

&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Inquirer Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/inquirer_readme.png&quot; title=&quot;Inquirer.js&quot;/&gt;

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the &quot;CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)&quot;).

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

&gt; **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)
&lt;a name=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Installation
&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

``` shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {
	// Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
```

&lt;a name=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Examples (Run it and see it)
Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.

``` shell
node examples/pizza.js
node examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```


### Methods
&lt;a name=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -&gt; promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -&gt; prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
&lt;a name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Question
&lt;a name=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
&lt;a name=&quot;answers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
&lt;a name=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ &quot;Choice A&quot;, new inquirer.Separator(), &quot;choice B&quot; ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 &gt; Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

&lt;a name=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Prompt types
---------------------

&gt; **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `&quot;Disabled&quot;`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/checkbox-prompt.png)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/confirm-prompt.png)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Input prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/input-prompt.png)

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/password-prompt.png)

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

&lt;a name=&quot;layouts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

&lt;a name=&quot;reactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.onCompleted();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
&lt;a name=&quot;support&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm
- **Windows**:
  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
  - cmd.exe
  - Powershell
  - Cygwin
- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:
  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)
  - konsole

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -&gt; prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
&lt;a name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Question
&lt;a name=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`. 

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
&lt;a name=&quot;answers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
&lt;a name=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ &quot;Choice A&quot;, new inquirer.Separator(), &quot;choice B&quot; ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 &gt; Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

&lt;a name=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Prompt types
---------------------

&gt; **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `&quot;Disabled&quot;`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/checkbox-prompt.png)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/confirm-prompt.png)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Input prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/input-prompt.png)

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/password-prompt.png)

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

&lt;a name=&quot;layouts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

&lt;a name=&quot;reactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.onCompleted();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
&lt;a name=&quot;support&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm
- **Windows**:
  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
  - cmd.exe
  - Powershell
  - Cygwin
- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:
  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)
  - konsole

## Goal and Philosophy

&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Inquirer Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/inquirer_readme.png&quot; title=&quot;Inquirer.js&quot;/&gt;

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the &quot;CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)&quot;).

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

&gt; **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)

```


### Methods
&lt;a name=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -&gt; promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -&gt; prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
&lt;a name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Question
&lt;a name=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.
- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.
- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 &gt; Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

## Goal and Philosophy

&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Inquirer Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/inquirer_readme.png&quot; title=&quot;Inquirer.js&quot;/&gt;

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the &quot;CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)&quot;).

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

&gt; **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)
&lt;a name=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Installation
&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

``` shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(answers =&gt; {
	// Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
```

&lt;a name=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Examples (Run it and see it)
Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.

``` shell
node examples/pizza.js
node examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```


### Methods
&lt;a name=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -&gt; promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -&gt; prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
&lt;a name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Question
&lt;a name=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **transformer**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the transformed value to be displayed to the user. The transformation only impacts what is shown while editing. It does not impact the `answers` hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.
- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.
- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronously. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter() {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function() {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
&lt;a name=&quot;answers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
&lt;a name=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ &quot;Choice A&quot;, new inquirer.Separator(), &quot;choice B&quot; ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 &gt; Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

&lt;a name=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Prompt types
---------------------

&gt; **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/list.svg)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/rawlist.svg)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/expand-y.svg)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/expand-d.svg)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `&quot;Disabled&quot;`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/checkbox.svg)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/confirm.svg)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`, `transformer`] properties.

![Input prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/input.svg)

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/password.svg)

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

&lt;a name=&quot;layouts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

&lt;a name=&quot;reactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.next({ /* question... */ });
prompts.next({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.complete();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
&lt;a name=&quot;support&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm
- **Windows**:
  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
  - cmd.exe
  - Powershell

                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

(This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.)

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

This is a JavaScript library for [escaping JavaScript strings](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes) while generating the shortest possible valid ASCII-only output. [Here’s an online demo.](http://mothereff.in/js-escapes)

This can be used to avoid [mojibake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) and other encoding issues, or even to [avoid errors](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/380000829643571200) when passing JSON-formatted data (which may contain U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR, or [lone surrogates](http://esdiscuss.org/topic/code-points-vs-unicode-scalar-values#content-14)) to a JavaScript parser or an UTF-8 encoder, respectively.

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

  }
);
```

## API

### `jsesc(value, options)`

This function takes a value and returns an escaped version of the value where any characters that are not printable ASCII symbols are escaped using the shortest possible (but valid) [escape sequences for use in JavaScript strings](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes). The first supported value type is strings:

```js
jsesc('Ich ♥ Bücher');
// → 'Ich \\u2665 B\\xFCcher'

jsesc('foo 𝌆 bar');
// → 'foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar'
```

Instead of a string, the `value` can also be an array, or an object. In such cases, `jsesc` will return a stringified version of the value where any characters that are not printable ASCII symbols are escaped in the same way.

```js
// Escaping an array
jsesc([
  'Ich ♥ Bücher', 'foo 𝌆 bar'
]);
// → '[\'Ich \\u2665 B\\xFCcher\',\'foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar\']'

// Escaping an object
jsesc({
  'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar'
});
// → '{\'Ich \\u2665 B\\xFCcher\':\'foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar\'}'
```

The optional `options` argument accepts an object with the following options:

#### `quotes`

The default value for the `quotes` option is `'single'`. This means that any occurences of `'` in the input string will be escaped as `\'`, so that the output can be used in a string literal wrapped in single quotes.

```js
jsesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.');
// → 'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'

jsesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single'
});
// → 'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'
// → &quot;Lorem ipsum \&quot;dolor\&quot; sit \\'amet\\' etc.&quot;
```

If you want to use the output as part of a string literal wrapped in double quotes, set the `quotes` option to `'double'`.

```js
jsesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double'
});
// → 'Lorem ipsum \\&quot;dolor\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.'
// → &quot;Lorem ipsum \\\&quot;dolor\\\&quot; sit 'amet' etc.&quot;
```

This setting also affects the output for arrays and objects:

```js
jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'quotes': 'double'
});
// → '{&quot;Ich \\u2665 B\\xFCcher&quot;:&quot;foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar&quot;}'

jsesc([ 'Ich ♥ Bücher', 'foo 𝌆 bar' ], {
  'quotes': 'double'
});
// → '[&quot;Ich \\u2665 B\\xFCcher&quot;,&quot;foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar&quot;]'
```

#### `wrap`

The `wrap` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, the output will be a valid JavaScript string literal wrapped in quotes. The type of quotes can be specified through the `quotes` setting.

```js
jsesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single',
  'wrap': true
});
// → '\'Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\''
// → &quot;\'Lorem ipsum \&quot;dolor\&quot; sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\'&quot;

jsesc('Lorem ipsum &quot;dolor&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double',
  'wrap': true
});
// → '&quot;Lorem ipsum \\&quot;dolor\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.&quot;'
// → &quot;\&quot;Lorem ipsum \\\&quot;dolor\\\&quot; sit \'amet\' etc.\&quot;&quot;
```

#### `es6`

The `es6` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, any astral Unicode symbols in the input will be escaped using [ECMAScript 6 Unicode code point escape sequences](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes#unicode-code-point) instead of using separate escape sequences for each surrogate half. If backwards compatibility with ES5 environments is a concern, don’t enable this setting. If the `json` setting is enabled, the value for the `es6` setting is ignored (as if it was `false`).

```js
// By default, the `es6` option is disabled:
jsesc('foo 𝌆 bar 💩 baz');
// → 'foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar \\uD83D\\uDCA9 baz'

// To explicitly disable it:
jsesc('foo 𝌆 bar 💩 baz', {
  'es6': false
});
// → 'foo \\uD834\\uDF06 bar \\uD83D\\uDCA9 baz'

// To enable it:
jsesc('foo 𝌆 bar 💩 baz', {
  'es6': true
});
// → 'foo \\u{1D306} bar \\u{1F4A9} baz'
```

#### `escapeEverything`

The `escapeEverything` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, all the symbols in the output will be escaped, even printable ASCII symbols.

```js
jsesc('lolwat&quot;foo\'bar', {
  'escapeEverything': true
});
// → '\\x6C\\x6F\\x6C\\x77\\x61\\x74\\&quot;\\x66\\x6F\\x6F\\\'\\x62\\x61\\x72'
// → &quot;\\x6C\\x6F\\x6C\\x77\\x61\\x74\\\&quot;\\x66\\x6F\\x6F\\'\\x62\\x61\\x72&quot;
```

This setting also affects the output for arrays and objects:

```js
jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'escapeEverything': true
});
// → '{\'\x49\x63\x68\x20\u2665\x20\x42\xFC\x63\x68\x65\x72\':\'\x66\x6F\x6F\x20\uD834\uDF06\x20\x62\x61\x72\'}'
// → &quot;{'\x49\x63\x68\x20\u2665\x20\x42\xFC\x63\x68\x65\x72':'\x66\x6F\x6F\x20\uD834\uDF06\x20\x62\x61\x72'}&quot;

jsesc([ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' ], {
  'escapeEverything': true
});
// → '[\'\x49\x63\x68\x20\u2665\x20\x42\xFC\x63\x68\x65\x72\',\'\x66\x6F\x6F\x20\uD834\uDF06\x20\x62\x61\x72\']'
```

#### `compact`

The `compact` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `true` (enabled). When enabled, the output for arrays and objects will be as compact as possible; it won’t be formatted nicely.

```js
jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'compact': true // this is the default
});
// → '{\'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\':\'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'}'

jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'compact': false
});
// → '{\n\t\'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\': \'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'\n}'

jsesc([ 'Ich ♥ Bücher', 'foo 𝌆 bar' ], {
  'compact': false
});
// → '[\n\t\'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\',\n\t\'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'\n]'
```

This setting has no effect on the output for strings.

#### `indent`

The `indent` option takes a string value, and defaults to `'\t'`. When the `compact` setting is enabled (`true`), the value of the `indent` option is used to format the output for arrays and objects.

```js
jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'compact': false,
  'indent': '\t' // this is the default
});
// → '{\n\t\'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\': \'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'\n}'

jsesc({ 'Ich ♥ Bücher': 'foo 𝌆 bar' }, {
  'compact': false,
  'indent': '  '
});
// → '{\n  \'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\': \'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'\n}'

jsesc([ 'Ich ♥ Bücher', 'foo 𝌆 bar' ], {
  'compact': false,
  'indent': '  '
});
// → '[\n  \'Ich \u2665 B\xFCcher\',\n\  t\'foo \uD834\uDF06 bar\'\n]'
```

This setting has no effect on the output for strings.

#### `json`

The `json` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, the output is valid JSON. [Hexadecimal character escape sequences](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes#hexadecimal) and [the `\v` or `\0` escape sequences](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes#single) will not be used. Setting `json: true` implies `quotes: 'double', wrap: true, es6: false`, although these values can still be overridden if needed — but in such cases, the output won’t be valid JSON anymore.

```js
jsesc('foo\x00bar\xFF\uFFFDbaz', {
  'json': true
});
// → '&quot;foo\\u0000bar\\u00FF\\uFFFDbaz&quot;'

jsesc({ 'foo\x00bar\xFF\uFFFDbaz': 'foo\x00bar\xFF\uFFFDbaz' }, {
  'json': true
});
// → '{&quot;foo\\u0000bar\\u00FF\\uFFFDbaz&quot;:&quot;foo\\u0000bar\\u00FF\\uFFFDbaz&quot;}'

jsesc([ 'foo\x00bar\xFF\uFFFDbaz', 'foo\x00bar\xFF\uFFFDbaz' ], {
  'json': true
});
// → '[&quot;foo\\u0000bar\\u00FF\\uFFFDbaz&quot;,&quot;foo\\u0000bar\\u00FF\\uFFFDbaz&quot;]'

// Values that are acceptable in JSON but aren’t strings, arrays, or object
// literals can’t be escaped, so they’ll just be preserved:
jsesc([ 'foo\x00bar', [1, '©', { 'foo': true, 'qux': null }], 42 ], {
  'json': true
});
// → '[&quot;foo\\u0000bar&quot;,[1,&quot;\\u00A9&quot;,{&quot;foo&quot;:true,&quot;qux&quot;:null}],42]'
// Values that aren’t allowed in JSON are run through `JSON.stringify()`:
jsesc([ undefined, -Infinity ], {
  'json': true
});
// → '[null,null]'
```

**Note:** Using this option on objects or arrays that contain non-string values relies on `JSON.stringify()`. For legacy environments like IE ≤ 7, use [a `JSON` polyfill](http://bestiejs.github.io/json3/).

### `jsesc.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

### Using the `jsesc` binary

To use the `jsesc` binary in your shell, simply install jsesc globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g jsesc
```

After that you will be able to escape strings from the command line:

```bash
$ jsesc 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz'
f\xF6o \u2665 b\xE5r \uD834\uDF06 baz
```

To escape arrays or objects containing string values, use the `-o`/`--object` option:

```bash
$ jsesc --object '{ &quot;föo&quot;: &quot;♥&quot;, &quot;bår&quot;: &quot;𝌆 baz&quot; }'
{'f\xF6o':'\u2665','b\xE5r':'\uD834\uDF06 baz'}
```

To prettify the output in such cases, use the `-p`/`--pretty` option:

```bash
$ jsesc --pretty '{ &quot;föo&quot;: &quot;♥&quot;, &quot;bår&quot;: &quot;𝌆 baz&quot; }'
{
  'f\xF6o': '\u2665',
  'b\xE5r': '\uD834\uDF06 baz'
}
```

For valid JSON output, use the `-j`/`--json` option:

```bash
$ jsesc --json --pretty '{ &quot;föo&quot;: &quot;♥&quot;, &quot;bår&quot;: &quot;𝌆 baz&quot; }'
{
  &quot;f\u00F6o&quot;: &quot;\u2665&quot;,
  &quot;b\u00E5r&quot;: &quot;\uD834\uDF06 baz&quot;
}
```

Read a local JSON file, escape any non-ASCII symbols, and save the result to a new file:

```bash
$ jsesc --json --object &lt; data-raw.json &gt; data-escaped.json
```

Or do the same with an online JSON file:

```bash
$ curl -sL &quot;http://git.io/aorKgQ&quot; | jsesc --json --object &gt; data-escaped.json
```

See `jsesc --help` for the full list of options.

## Support

This library has been tested in at least Chrome 27-29, Firefox 3-22, Safari 4-6, Opera 10-12, IE 6-10, Node.js v0.10.0, Narwhal 0.3.2, RingoJS 0.8-0.9, PhantomJS 1.9.0, and Rhino 1.7RC4.

**Note:** Using the `json` option on objects or arrays that contain non-string values relies on `JSON.parse()`. For legacy environments like IE ≤ 7, use [a `JSON` polyfill](http://bestiejs.github.io/json3/).

## Unit tests &amp; code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.

=======

This module provides Douglas Crockford's JSON implementation without modifying
any globals.

`stringify` and `parse` are merely exported without respect to whether or not a
global `JSON` object exists.

methods
=======

var json = require('jsonify');

json.parse(source, reviver)
---------------------------

Return a new javascript object from a parse of the `source` string.

If a `reviver` function is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value
pair to `reviver.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before
parsing it.

json.stringify(value, replacer, space)
--------------------------------------

Return a string representation for `value`.

If `replacer` is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to
`replacer.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before stringifying
it.

If `space` is a number, indent the result by that many spaces.
If `space` is a string, use `space` as the indentation.</pre></section></details><details><summary>jsonpointer@4.0.1</summary><section><h3>jsonpointer@4.0.1</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

&gt; *Create streams lazily when they are read from or written to.*  
&gt; `lazystream: 1.0.0` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpommerening/node-lazystream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpommerening/node-lazystream)  

## Why?

Sometimes you feel the itch to open *all the files* at once. You want to pass a bunch of streams around, so the consumer does not need to worry where the data comes from.
From a software design point-of-view this sounds entirely reasonable. Then there is that neat little function `fs.createReadStream()` that opens a file and gives you a nice `fs.ReadStream` to pass around, so you use what the mighty creator deities of node bestowed upon you.

&gt; `Error: EMFILE, too many open files`  
&gt; ─ *node*

This package provides two classes based on the node's Streams3 API (courtesy of `readable-stream` to ensure a stable version).

## Class: lazystream.Readable

A wrapper for readable streams. Extends [`stream.PassThrough`](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough).

### new lazystream.Readable(fn [, options])

* `fn` *{Function}*  
  The function that the lazy stream will call to obtain the stream to actually read from.
* `options` *{Object}*  
  Options for the underlying `PassThrough` stream, accessible by `fn`.

Creates a new readable stream. Once the stream is accessed (for example when you call its `read()` method, or attach a `data`-event listener) the `fn` function is called with the outer `lazystream.Readable` instance bound to `this`.

If you pass an `options` object to the constuctor, you can access it in your `fn` function.

```javascript
new lazystream.Readable(function (options) {
  return fs.createReadStream('/dev/urandom');
});
```

## Class: lazystream.Writable

A wrapper for writable streams. Extends [`stream.PassThrough`](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough).

### new lazystream.Writable(fn [, options])

* `fn` *{Function}*  
  The function that the lazy stream will call to obtain the stream to actually write to.
* `options` *{Object}*  
  Options for the underlying `PassThrough` stream, accessible by `fn`.

Creates a new writable stream. Just like the one above but for writable streams.

```javascript
new lazystream.Writable(function () {
  return fs.createWriteStream('/dev/null');
});
```

## Install

```console
$ npm install lazystream --save
lazystream@1.0.0 node_modules/lazystream
└── readable-stream@2.0.5
```

## Changelog

### v1.0.0

- [#2](https://github.com/jpommerening/node-lazystream/pull/2): [unconditionally](https://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html) use `readable-stream` _2.x_.

### v0.2.0

- [#1](https://github.com/jpommerening/node-lazystream/pull/1): error events are now propagated

### v0.1.0

- _(this was the first release)_

## Contributing

Fork it, branch it, send me a pull request. We'll work out the rest together.

===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scravy/node-macaddress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scravy/node-macaddress)

Retrieve MAC addresses in Linux, OS X, and Windows.

A common misconception about MAC addresses is that every *host* had *one* MAC address,
while a host may have *multiple* MAC addresses – since *every network interface* may
have its own MAC address.

This library allows to discover the MAC address per network interface and chooses
an appropriate interface if all you're interested in is *one* MAC address identifying
the host system (see `API + Examples` below).

**Features:**

+ works on `Linux`, `Mac OS X`, `Windows`, and on most `UNIX` systems.
+ `node ≥ 0.12` and `io.js` report MAC addresses in `os.networkInterfaces()`
  this library utilizes this information when available.
+ also features a sane replacement for `os.networkInterfaces()`
  (see `API + Examples` below).
+ works with stoneage node versions ≥ v0.8 (...)

Usage
-----

```
npm install --save macaddress
```

```JavaScript
var macaddress = require('macaddress');
```

API + Examples
--------------

    (async)  .one(iface, callback) → string
    (async)  .one(callback)        → string
    (async)  .all(callback)        → { iface: { type: address } }
    (sync)   .networkInterfaces()  → { iface: { type: address } }

---

### `.one([iface], callback)`

Retrieves the MAC address of the given `iface`.

If `iface` is omitted, this function automatically chooses an
appropriate device (e.g. `eth0` in Linux, `en0` in OS X, etc.).

**Without `iface` parameter:**

```JavaScript
macaddress.one(function (err, mac) {
  console.log(&quot;Mac address for this host: %s&quot;, mac);  
});
```

```
→ Mac address for this host: ab:42:de:13:ef:37
```

**With `iface` parameter:**

```JavaScript
macaddress.one('awdl0', function (err, mac) {
  console.log(&quot;Mac address for awdl0: %s&quot;, mac);  
});
```

```
→ Mac address for awdl0: ab:cd:ef:34:12:56
```

---

### `.all(callback)`

Retrieves the MAC addresses for all non-internal interfaces.

```JavaScript
macaddress.all(function (err, all) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(all, null, 2));
});
```

```JavaScript
{
  &quot;en0&quot;: {
    &quot;ipv6&quot;: &quot;fe80::cae0:ebff:fe14:1da9&quot;,
    &quot;ipv4&quot;: &quot;192.168.178.20&quot;,
    &quot;mac&quot;: &quot;ab:42:de:13:ef:37&quot;
  },
  &quot;awdl0&quot;: {
    &quot;ipv6&quot;: &quot;fe80::58b9:daff:fea9:23a9&quot;,
    &quot;mac&quot;: &quot;ab:cd:ef:34:12:56&quot;
  }
}
```

---

### `.networkInterfaces()`

A useful replacement of `os.networkInterfaces()`. Reports only non-internal interfaces.

```JavaScript
console.log(JSON.stringify(macaddress.networkInterfaces(), null, 2));
```

```JavaScript
{
  &quot;en0&quot;: {
    &quot;ipv6&quot;: &quot;fe80::cae0:ebff:fe14:1dab&quot;,
    &quot;ipv4&quot;: &quot;192.168.178.22&quot;
  },
  &quot;awdl0&quot;: {
    &quot;ipv6&quot;: &quot;fe80::58b9:daff:fea9:23a9&quot;
  }
}
```</pre></section></details><details><summary>make-dir@1.2.0</summary><section><h3>make-dir@1.2.0</h3><pre>MIT License

&gt; Make your own error types!


## Features

- Compatible Node &amp; browsers
- `instanceof` support
- `error.name` &amp; `error.stack` support
- compatible with [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) (i.e. no `eval()`)

## Installation

### Node &amp; [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)/[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

Installation of the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/make-error):

```
&gt; npm install --save make-error
```

## Usage

### Basic named error

```javascript
var CustomError = makeError('CustomError')

// Parameters are forwarded to the super class (here Error).
throw new CustomError('a message')
```

### Advanced error class

```javascript
function CustomError (customValue) {
  CustomError.super.call(this, 'custom error message')

  this.customValue = customValue
}
makeError(CustomError)

// Feel free to extend the prototype.
CustomError.prototype.myMethod = function CustomError$myMethod () {
  console.log('CustomError.myMethod (%s, %s)', this.code, this.message)
}

//-----

try {
  throw new CustomError(42)
} catch (error) {
  error.myMethod()
}
```

### Specialized error

```javascript
var SpecializedError = makeError('SpecializedError', CustomError);

throw new SpecializedError(42);
```

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

=============

File edition helpers working on top of [mem-fs](https://github.com/SBoudrias/mem-fs)

Usage
-------------

```js
var memFs = require('mem-fs');
var editor = require('mem-fs-editor');

var store = memFs.create();
var fs = editor.create(store);

fs.write('somefile.js', 'var a = 1;');
```

### `#read(filepath, [options])`

Read a file and return its contents as a string.

You can alternatively get the raw contents buffer if you pass `options.raw = true`.

By default, calling `read()` on a file path that does not exist throws error. You can, however, pass `options.defaults = 'your default content'` to get a default content you pass in, if you prefer to not deal with try/catch.

### `#readJSON(filepath, [defaults])`

Read a file and parse its contents as JSON.

`readJSON()` internally calls `read()` and will throw error if the file path you pass in does not exist. But if you pass in an optional `defaults`, the `defaults` content will be returned in case of the target file is missing, instead of throwing error (error would still be thrown if JSON.parse failed to parse your target file).

### `#write(filepath, contents)`

Replace the content of a file (existing or new) with a string or a buffer.

### `#writeJSON(filepath, contents[, replacer [, space]])`

Replace the content of a file (existing or new) with an object that is to be converted by calling `JSON.stringify()`.

`contents` should usually be a JSON object, but it can technically be anything that is acceptable by [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

Optionally pass `replacer` and `space` as the last two arguments, as defined by [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). `spacer` is used to format the output string (prettify).

Default value for `space` is `2`, when not specified.

### `#append(filepath, contents, [options])`

Append the new contents to the current file contents.

- `options.trimEnd` (default `true`). Trim trailing whitespace of the current file contents.
- `options.separator` (default `os.EOL`). Separator to insert between current and new contents.

### `#extendJSON(filepath, contents[, replacer [, space]])`

Extend the content of an existing JSON file with the partial objects provided as argument.

Optionally take the same JSON formatting arguments than `#writeJSON()`.

### `#delete(filepath, [options])`

Delete a file or a directory.

`filePath` can also be a `glob`. If `filePath` is glob, you can optionally pass in an `options.globOptions` object to change its pattern matching behavior. The full list of options are being described [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options). The `sync` flag is forced to be `true` in `globOptions`.

### `#copy(from, to, [options])`

Copy a file from the `from` path to the `to` path.

Optionally, pass an `options.process` function (`process(contents)`) returning a string or a buffer who'll become the new file content. The process function will take a single contents argument who is the copied file contents as a `Buffer`.

`from` can be a glob pattern that'll be match against the file system. If that's the case, then `to` must be an output directory. For a globified `from`, you can optionally pass in an `options.globOptions` object to change its pattern matching behavior. The full list of options are being described [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options). The `nodir` flag is forced to be `true` in `globOptions` to ensure a vinyl object representing each matching directory is marked as `deleted` in the `mem-fs` store.

### `#copyTpl(from, to, context[, templateOptions [, copyOptions]])`

Copy the `from` file and parse its content as an [ejs](http://ejs.co/) template where `context` is the template context (the variable names available inside the template).

You can optionally pass a `templateOptions` object. `mem-fs-editor` automatically setup the filename option so you can easily use partials.

You can also optionally pass a `copyOptions` object (see [copy() documentation for more details](https://github.com/SBoudrias/mem-fs-editor#copyfrom-to-options)).

Templates syntax looks like this:

```
&lt;%= value %&gt;
&lt;%- include('partial.ejs', { name: 'Simon' }) %&gt;
```

Refer to the [ejs documentation](http://ejs.co/) for more details.

### `#move(from, to, [options])`

Move/rename a file from the `from` path to the `to` path.

`#move` internally uses `#copy` and `#delete`, so `from` can be a glob pattern, and you can provide `options.globOptions` with it.

### `#exists(filepath)`

Returns `true` if a file exists. Returns `false` if the file is not found or deleted.

### `#commit([filters,] callback)`

Persist every changes made to files in the mem-fs store to disk.

If provided, `filters` is an array of TransformStream to be applied on a stream of vinyl files (like gulp plugins).

`callback` is called once the files are updated on disk.</pre></section></details><details><summary>mem-fs@1.1.3</summary><section><h3>mem-fs@1.1.3</h3><pre></pre></section></details><details><summary>mem@1.1.0</summary><section><h3>mem@1.1.0</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A better `Stream#pipe` that creates duplex streams and lets you handle errors in one place.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/segmentio/multipipe.png)](http://travis-ci.org/segmentio/multipipe)

## Example

```js
var pipe = require('multipipe');

// pipe streams
var stream = pipe(streamA, streamB, streamC);

// centralized error handling
stream.on('error', fn);

// creates a new stream
source.pipe(stream).pipe(dest);

// optional callback on finish or error
pipe(streamA, streamB, streamC, function(err){
  // ...
});
```

## Duplex streams

  Write to the pipe and you'll really write to the first stream, read from the pipe and you'll read from the last stream.

```js
var stream = pipe(a, b, c);

source
  .pipe(stream)
  .pipe(destination);
```

  In this example the flow of data is:

  * source -&gt;
  * a -&gt;
  * b -&gt;
  * c -&gt;
  * destination

## Error handling

  Each `pipe` forwards the errors the streams it wraps emit, so you have one central place to handle errors:

```js
var stream = pipe(a, b, c);

stream.on('error', function(err){
  // called three times
});

a.emit('error', new Error);
b.emit('error', new Error);
c.emit('error', new Error);
```

## API

### pipe(stream, ...)

Pass a variable number of streams and each will be piped to the next one.

A stream will be returned that wraps passed in streams in a way that errors will be forwarded and you can write to and/or read from it.

Pass a function as last argument to be called on `error` or `finish` of the last stream.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install multipipe
```

Do stuff with Node.js's native JavaScript modules

## Caveat

Dear Beloved User,

I feel compelled to give you a word of warning if you are considering
using this module.

This module lets you do some creative things with the JavaScript code
in Node.js.  There are some things here that are basically a recipe
for memory leaks, or at the very least, being broken with each new
release of Node, since none of these API surfaces are &quot;technically&quot;
&quot;supported&quot; by the team managing the Node.js project.

This module does not ship a _copy_ of Node's internals.  It does its
thing by using the exposed source code that lives in Node.js itself.
So, running this on different versions of Node.js will produce
different results.

When your program is broken by changes to Node's internals, or when
Node changes in such a way that this module becomes fundamentally
broken, you will likely get little sympathy.  Many people in the Node
community consider this sort of behavior to be unwise and unseemly, if
not outright hostile and morally wrong.

At the very least, you probably just want to run Node with the
(undocumented!) `--expose-internals` flag, rather than go to such
lengths.

Don't use unless you know what you're doing, or at least, are ok with
the risks.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

Eternally Yours in OSS,  
Isaac Z. Schlueter

## USAGE

```javascript
var natives = require('natives')

// get the source code
var fsCode = natives.source('fs')

// get a evaluated copy of the module
var fsCopy = natives.require('fs')

// you can pass in a whitelist to NOT shim certain things
var fsCopyWithNativeStreams = natives.require('fs', ['stream'])

// note that this is not the same as the &quot;real&quot; fs
assert(fsCopy !== require('fs'))

// but it does have all the same entries
fsCopy.readFileSync(__filename, 'utf8') // etc
```

## Another Caveat

You can't use this to override `require(&quot;buffer&quot;)` because everything
depends on `Buffer.isBuffer` working properly, so it's important for
that one to be given a pass.</pre></section></details><details><summary>natural-compare@1.4.0</summary><section><h3>natural-compare@1.4.0</h3><pre>[Build]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png

Natural Compare &amp;ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a &quot;natural ordering&quot;.

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
&lt;script src=min.natural-compare.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require(&quot;natural-compare-lite&quot;)
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = [&quot;z1.doc&quot;, &quot;z10.doc&quot;, &quot;z17.doc&quot;, &quot;z2.doc&quot;, &quot;z23.doc&quot;, &quot;z3.doc&quot;];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// [&quot;z1.doc&quot;, &quot;z2.doc&quot;, &quot;z3.doc&quot;, &quot;z10.doc&quot;, &quot;z17.doc&quot;, &quot;z23.doc&quot;]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {&quot;street&quot;:&quot;350 5th Ave&quot;, &quot;room&quot;:&quot;A-1021&quot;}
        , {&quot;street&quot;:&quot;350 5th Ave&quot;, &quot;room&quot;:&quot;A-21046-b&quot;} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {&quot;make&quot;:&quot;Audi&quot;, &quot;model&quot;:&quot;A6&quot;}
        , {&quot;make&quot;:&quot;Kia&quot;,  &quot;model&quot;:&quot;Rio&quot;} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + &quot; &quot; + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg &quot;Rev 2012-07-26.doc&quot;.


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = &quot;ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy&quot;
[&quot;t&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;õ&quot;].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// [&quot;z&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;õ&quot;, &quot;x&quot;]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = &quot;АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя&quot;
[&quot;Ё&quot;, &quot;А&quot;, &quot;Б&quot;].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// [&quot;А&quot;, &quot;Б&quot;, &quot;Ё&quot;]
```

Neo-Async is thought to be used as a drop-in replacement for [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), it almost fully covers its functionality and runs [faster](#benchmark).

Benchmark is [here](#benchmark)!

Bluebird's benchmark is [here](https://github.com/suguru03/bluebird/tree/aigle/benchmark)!

## Code Coverage
![coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/suguru03/neo-async/images/coverage.png)

## Installation

### In a browser
```html
&lt;script src=&quot;async.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

### In an AMD loader
```js
require(['async'], function(async) {});
```

### Promise and async/await

I recommend to use [`Aigle`](https://github.com/suguru03/aigle).

It is optimized for Promise handling and has almost the same functionality as `neo-async`.

### Node.js

#### standard

```bash
$ npm install neo-async
```
```js
var async = require('neo-async');
```

#### replacement
```bash
$ npm install neo-async
$ ln -s ./node_modules/neo-async ./node_modules/async
```
```js
var async = require('async');
```

### Bower

```bash
bower install neo-async
```

## Feature

## Benchmark

[Benchmark: Async vs Neo-Async](http://suguru03.hatenablog.com/entry/2016/06/10/135559)

### How to check

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:suguru03/async-benchmark.git
$ cd async-benchmark
$ npm install
$ node . // It might take more than one hour...
```

### Environment

* Ubuntu v12.04
* Node.js v6.2.1
* async v2.0.0-rc.6
* neo-async v2.0.0-rc.1
* benchmark v2.1.0
* func-comparator v0.7.1

### Result

Neo-Async is 1.27 ~ 10.7 times faster than Async.

The value is the ratio (Neo-Async/Async) of the average speed.

A performant nth-check parser &amp; compiler.

###About

This module can be used to parse &amp; compile nth-checks, as they are found in CSS 3's `nth-child()` and `nth-last-of-type()`.

`nth-check` focusses on speed, providing optimized functions for different kinds of nth-child formulas, while still following the [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo).

###API

```js
var nthCheck = require(&quot;nth-check&quot;);
```

#####`nthCheck(formula)`

First parses, then compiles the formula.

#####`nthCheck.parse(formula)`

Parses the expression, throws a `SyntaxError` if it fails, otherwise returns an array containing two elements.

__Example:__

```js
nthCheck.parse(&quot;2n+3&quot;) //[2, 3]
```

#####`nthCheck.compile([a, b])`

Takes an array with two elements (as returned by `.parse`) and returns a highly optimized function.

If the formula doesn't match any elements, it returns [`boolbase`](https://github.com/fb55/boolbase)'s `falseFunc`, otherwise, a function accepting an _index_ is returned, which returns whether or not a passed _index_ matches the formula. (Note: The spec starts counting at `1`, the returned function at `0`).

__Example:__
```js
var check = nthCheck.compile([2, 3]);

check(0) //false
check(1) //false
check(2) //true
check(3) //false
check(4) //true
check(5) //false
check(6) //true
```

Like [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) but deeper. This module is the holy grail of simple object manipulation in JavaScript and it does not resort to using the JSON functions. If you need more power or fine-grained control please take a look at the [Object-Extender](https://npmjs.org/package/object-extender) module.

## Breaking Changes in v0.3!
* `objectAssignDeep()` now mutates the first argument in the same way `Object.assign()` does.
* By default, arrays are now replaced instead of merged to preserve backwards compatibility with older versions of this module.

## Caution! Danger of Death!
This module is to be used with PLAIN objects that contain primitive values ONLY. Every time you misuse this module a kitten dies.. yes you're a kitten killer.

Do not use this module if:
* Your objects are (or contain) native objects such as Date (nested Array is fine).
* Your objects contain circular references (you'll cause a stack overflow).
* Your objects are instances of some class you've written.
* You are concerned with prototype chains, property descriptors, unenumerable properties, and any other advanced uses.

If you need to do something fancy like the above you'll need to write a custom solution for your use case.

## Quick Start
You can merge plain objects or clone them:

```javascript
const objectAssignDeep = require(`object-assign-deep`);

const mergedObjects = objectAssignDeep(target, object1, object2, ...objectN);

const clonedObject = objectAssignDeep({}, originalObject);
```

Simples!

## Full Example
See the `./examples` directory for a few examples, including one example case that demonstrates why you can't get clever with object cloning.

```javascript
const objectAssignDeep = require(`object-assign-deep`);

const objectA = {
	prop1: `Hello`,
	prop2: `World`,
	nested: {
		bool: true,
		super: 123,
		still: `here!`,
	},
	array1: [1, 2, 3],
	array2: [4, 5, 6],
};

const objectB = {
	prop2: `Universe`,
	name: `Josh`,
	nested: {
		bool: false,
	},
	array1: null,
};

const objectC = {
	location: `United Kingdom`,
	name: `Bob`,
	nested: {
		super: 999,
	},
	array2: [100, 101, 102],
};

const result = objectAssignDeep(objectA, objectB, objectC);

console.log(`Result:`, result);

/*
*   {
*     prop1: 'Hello',
*     prop2: 'Universe',
*     nested: { bool: false, super: 999, still: 'here!' },
*     array1: null,
*     array2: [100, 101, 102],
*     name: 'Bob',
*     location: 'United Kingdom'
*   }
*/
```

## API Overview

### objectAssignDeep(target, object1, object2, ...objectN);
Merges all the objects together mutating the `target` in the process and returning the result.

### objectAssignDeep.noMutate(object1, object2, ...objectN);
Merges all the objects together without mutating any of them and returning the entirely new object.

### objectAssignDeep.withOptions(target, objects, options);
Takes a target, an array of objects to merge in, and an options object which can be used to change the behaviour of the function. The available options are:

| Option         | Default Value | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| arrayBehaviour | &quot;replace&quot;     | By default arrays in later objects will overwrite earlier values, but you can set this to &quot;merge&quot; if you want to concatenate the arrays instead. |

If you need more customisation options please take a look at the [Object-Extender](https://npmjs.org/package/object-extender) module which builds upon Object-Assign-Deep.</pre></section></details><details><summary>object-assign@2.1.1</summary><section><h3>object-assign@2.1.1</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

&lt;!-- 🚨 HEY! HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 --&gt;

## Wut? Poppers?

A popper is an element on the screen which &quot;pops out&quot; from the natural flow of your application.  
Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.


## So, yet another tooltip library?

Well, basically, **no**.  
Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element
to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**
(similar to middlewares or plugins).  
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  
It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

### Popper.js

This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to
the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;

Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).


### Tooltip.js

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,
we created **Tooltip.js**.  
It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  
Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be
easy to integrate it in your projects.  
The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).


## Installation
Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |
| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |
| NuGet  | `PM&gt; Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |
| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

Tooltip.js as well:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |
| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |
| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  
For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).

### Dist targets

Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.

- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;
- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `&lt;script&gt;` tag, use UMD.

## Usage

Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button

```js
var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
var anotherPopper = new Popper(
    reference,
    popper,
    {
        // popper options here
    }
);
```

### Callbacks

Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after
the popper has been initalized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.

```js
const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    onCreate: (data) =&gt; {
        // data is an object containing all the informations computed
        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow
        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation
    },
    onUpdate: (data) =&gt; {
        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates
    }
});
```

### Writing your own modifiers

Popper.js is based on a &quot;plugin-like&quot; architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated &quot;modifiers&quot;.  
A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  

To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)


### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration

Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because
they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  
Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,
you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using
your library of choice.  

For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing
frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and
integrate Popper.js by yourself!

```js
function applyReactStyle(data) {
    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper
};

const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    modifiers: {
        applyStyle: { enabled: false },
        applyReactStyle: {
            enabled: true,
            fn: applyReactStyle,
            order: 800,
        },
    },
});

```

### Migration from Popper.js v0

Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to
Popper.js v1.  

https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62

Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.

### Performances

Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  
This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.

## Notes

### Libraries using Popper.js

The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to
be used in 3rd party libraries.  

Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.

&gt; Minify colors in your CSS files with PostCSS.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-colormin) do:

```
npm install postcss-colormin --save
```


## Example

```js
var postcss = require('postcss')
var colormin = require('postcss-colormin');

var css = 'h1 {color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)}';
console.log(postcss(colormin()).process(css).css);

// =&gt; 'h1 {color:red}'
```

For more examples see the [tests](src/__tests__/index.js).


## API

### colormin([options])

#### options

##### legacy

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to enable IE &lt; 10 compatibility; the browser chokes on the
`transparent` keyword, so in this mode the conversion from `rgba(0,0,0,0)`
is turned off.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you add functionality, then please add unit tests
to cover it.

&gt; Convert values with PostCSS (e.g. ms -&gt; s)

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-convert-values) do:

```
npm install postcss-convert-values --save
```

## Example

This plugin reduces CSS size by converting values to use different units
where possible; for example, `500ms` can be represented as `.5s`. You can
read more about these units in [this article][csstricks].

### Input

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 16px;
    width: 0em
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 1pc;
    width: 0
}
```

Note that this plugin only covers conversions for duration and absolute length
values. For color conversions, use [postcss-colormin][colormin].

## API

### convertValues([options])

#### options

##### length

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Pass `false` to disable conversion from `px` to other absolute length units,
such as `pc` &amp; `pt` &amp; vice versa.

##### time

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Pass `false` to disable conversion from `ms` to `s` &amp; vice versa.

##### angle

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Pass `false` to disable conversion from `deg` to `turn` &amp; vice versa.

##### precision

Type: `boolean|number`
Default: `false`

Specify any numeric value here to round `px` values to that many decimal places;
for example, using `{precision: 2}` will round `6.66667px` to `6.67px`, and
`{precision: 0}` will round it to `7px`. Passing `false` (the default) will
leave these values as is.

It is recommended for most use cases to set this option to `2`.

&gt; Discard comments in your CSS files with PostCSS.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-discard-comments) do:

```
npm install postcss-discard-comments --save
```


## Example

### Input

```css
h1/* heading */{
    margin: 0 auto
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    margin: 0 auto
}
```

This module discards comments from your CSS files; by default, it will remove
all regular comments (`/* comment */`) and preserve comments marked as important
(`/*! important */`).

Note that this module does not handle source map comments because they are not
available to it; PostCSS handles this internally, so if they are removed then
you will have to [configure source maps in PostCSS][maps].

[maps]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/source-maps.md


## API

### comments([options])

#### options

##### remove(function)

Type: `function`
Return: `boolean`
Variable: `comment` contains a comment without `/**/`

For each comment, return true to remove, or false to keep the comment.

```js
function(comment) {}
```

```js
var css = '/* headings *//*@ h1 */h1{margin:0 auto}/*@ h2 */h2{color:red}';
console.log(postcss(comments({
    remove: function(comment) { return comment[0] == &quot;@&quot;; }
})).process(css).css);
//=&gt; /* headings */h1{margin:0 auto}h2{color:red}
```
**NOTE:** If you use the `remove` function other options will not be available.

##### removeAll

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Remove all comments marked as important.

```js
var css = '/*! heading */h1{margin:0 auto}/*! heading 2 */h2{color:red}';
console.log(postcss(comments({removeAll: true})).process(css).css);
//=&gt; h1{margin:0 auto}h2{color:red}
```

##### removeAllButFirst

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Remove all comments marked as important, but the first one.

```js
var css = '/*! heading */h1{margin:0 auto}/*! heading 2 */h2{color:red}';
console.log(postcss(comments({removeAllButFirst: true})).process(css).css);
//=&gt; /*! heading */h1{margin:0 auto}h2{color:red}
```

&gt; Discard duplicate rules in your CSS files with PostCSS.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-discard-duplicates) do:

```
npm install postcss-discard-duplicates --save
```

## Example

This module will remove all duplicate rules from your stylesheets. It works on
at rules, normal rules and declarations. Note that this module does not have any
responsibility for normalising declarations, selectors or whitespace, so that it
considers these two rules to be different:

```css
h1, h2 {
    color: blue;
}

h2, h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

It has to assume that your rules have already been transformed by another
processor, otherwise it would be responsible for too many things.

### Input

```css
h1 {
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin: 0 auto
}

h1 {
    margin: 0 auto
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    margin: 0 auto
}
```

&gt; Discard unused counter styles, keyframes and fonts.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-discard-unused) do:

```
npm install postcss-discard-unused --save
```


## Example

This module will discard unused at rules in your CSS file, if it cannot find
any selectors that make use of them. It works on `@counter-style`, `@keyframes`
and `@font-face`.

### Input

```css
@counter-style custom {
    system: extends decimal;
    suffix: &quot;&gt; &quot;
}

@counter-style custom2 {
    system: extends decimal;
    suffix: &quot;| &quot;
}

a {
    list-style: custom
}
```

### Output

```css
@counter-style custom {
    system: extends decimal;
    suffix: &quot;&gt; &quot;
}

a {
    list-style: custom
}
```

Note that this plugin is not responsible for normalising font families, as it
makes the assumption that you will write your font names consistently, such that
it considers these two declarations differently:

```css
h1 {
    font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;
}

h2 {
    font-family: Helvetica Neue
}
```

However, you can mitigate this by including [postcss-minify-font-values][mfv]
*before* this plugin, which will take care of normalising quotes, and
deduplicating. For more examples, see the [tests](test.js).


## Usage

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for
examples for your environment.


## API

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `true`

Pass `false` to disable discarding unused font face rules.

##### counterStyle

Type: `boolean`

&gt; Exclude/warn on duplicated PostCSS plugins.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-filter-plugins) do:

```console
$ npm install postcss-filter-plugins --save
```

## Example

Note that this plugin does not actually transform your CSS; instead, it ensures
that plugins in the PostCSS instance are not duplicated. It is intended to be
used by plugin packs such as [cssnano] or [cssnext].

```js
var counter = postcss.plugin('counter', function () {
    return function (css) {
        css.eachDecl('foo', function (decl) {
            let value = parseInt(decl.value, 10);
            value += 1;
            decl.value = String(value);
        });
    }
});

var css = 'h1 { foo: 1 }';
var out = postcss([
    filter(),
    counter(),
    counter()
]).process(css).css;

console.log(out);
// =&gt; h1 { foo: 2 }
// Note that you will get a PostCSS warning in the message registry
```

## API

### filterPlugins([options])

#### options

##### direction

Type: `string`  
Default: `'both'`

Pass `'forward'`, `'backward'`, or `'both'` to customise the direction in which the
plugin will look in the plugins array. See the [tests] for examples on how this
works.

```js
postcss([ filter({
    direction: 'forward'
}) ]).process(css).css);
```

##### exclude

Type: `array`  
Default: `[] (empty)`

Plugins that should be excluded from the filter. Pass an array of plugin names.

```js
postcss([ filter({
    exclude: ['postcss-cssstats']
}) ]).process(css).css);
```

##### silent

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set this to true to disable the plugin from emitting any PostCSS warnings.

```js
postcss([ filter({
    silent: true
}) ]).process(css).css);
```

##### template

Type: `function`  
Default: `format function`

This function will be passed each PostCSS plugin object. You are expected to
return a string from each call, which is then used to warn the user about her
duplicated plugins.

```js
postcss([ filter({
    template: function (plugin) {
        return 'Duplicate plugin found: ' + plugin.postcssPlugin;
    }
}) ]).process(css).css);
```

&gt; Merge keyframe and counter style identifiers.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-merge-idents) do:

```
npm install postcss-merge-idents --save
```


## Example

This module will merge identifiers such as `@keyframes` and `@counter-style`,
if their properties are identical. Then, it will update those declarations that
depend on the duplicated property.

### Input

```css
@keyframes rotate {
    from { transform: rotate(0) }
    to { transform: rotate(360deg) }
}

@keyframes flip {
    from { transform: rotate(0) }
    to { transform: rotate(360deg) }
}

.rotate {
    animation-name: rotate
}

.flip {
    animation-name: flip
}
```

### Output

```css
@keyframes flip {
    from { transform: rotate(0) }
    to { transform: rotate(360deg) }
}

.rotate {
    animation-name: flip
}

.flip {
    animation-name: flip
}
```

&gt; Minify gradient parameters with PostCSS.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-minify-gradients) do:

```
npm install postcss-minify-gradients
```


## Example

Where possible, this module will minify gradient parameters. It can convert
linear gradient directional syntax to angles, remove the unnecessary `0%` and
`100%` start and end values, and minimise color stops that use the same length
values (the browser will adjust the value automatically).

### Input

```css
h1 {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffe500 0%, #ffe500 50%, #121 50%, #121 100%)
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, #ffe500, #ffe500 50%, #121 0, #121)
}
```


## Usage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-extract-imports.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-extract-imports)

Transforms:

```css
:local(.continueButton) {
  composes: button from &quot;library/button.css&quot;;
  color: green;
}
```

into:

```css
:import(&quot;library/button.css&quot;) {

}
:local(.continueButton) {
  composes: __tmp_487387465fczSDGHSABb;
  color: green;
}
```

## Specification

- Only a certain whitelist of properties are inspected. Currently, that whitelist is `['composes']` alone.
- An extend-import has the following format:
```
composes: className [... className] from &quot;path/to/file.css&quot;;
```

## Building

```
npm install
npm build
npm test
```

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)

Transforms:

```css
:local(.continueButton) {
  color: green;
}
```

into:

```css
:export {
  continueButton: __buttons_continueButton_djd347adcxz9;
}
.__buttons_continueButton_djd347adcxz9 {
  color: green;
}
```

so it doesn't pollute CSS global scope and can be simply used in JS like so:

```js
import styles from './buttons.css'
elem.innerHTML = `&lt;button class=&quot;${styles.continueButton}&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;`
```

## Composition

Since we're exporting class names, there's no reason to export only one. This can give us some really useful reuse of styles:

```css
.globalButtonStyle {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
.globalButtonStyle:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;
}
:local(.continueButton) {
  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
  color: green;
}
```

becomes:

```
.globalButtonStyle {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
.globalButtonStyle:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;
}
:local(.continueButton) {
  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
  color: green;
}
```

**Note:** you can also use `composes` as a shorthand for `compose-with`

## Local-by-default &amp; reuse across files

You're looking for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It uses this plugin as well as a few others, and it's amazing.

## Building

```
npm install
npm test
```

Pass arbitrary values between your module files

### Usage

```css
/* colors.css */
@value primary: #BF4040;
@value secondary: #1F4F7F;

.text-primary {
  color: primary;
}

.text-secondary {
  color: secondary;
}
```

```css
/* breakpoints.css */
@value small: (max-width: 599px);
@value medium: (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959px);
@value large: (min-width: 960px);
```

```css
/* my-component.css */
/* alias paths for other values or composition */
@value colors: &quot;./colors.css&quot;; 
/* import multiple from a single file */
@value primary, secondary from colors;
/* make local aliases to imported values */
@value small as bp-small, large as bp-large from &quot;./breakpoints.css&quot;;

.header {
  composes: text-primary from colors;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px secondary;
}

@media bp-small {
  .header {
    box-shadow: 0 0 4px secondary;
  }
}
@media bp-large {
  .header {
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px secondary;
  }
}
```

**If you are using Sass** along with this PostCSS plugin, do not use the colon `:` in your `@value` definitions. It will cause Sass to crash.

Note also you can _import_ multiple values at once but can only _define_ one value per line.

```css
@value a: b, c: d; /* defines a as &quot;b, c: d&quot; */
```

&gt; Ensure values are ordered consistently in your CSS.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-ordered-values) do:

```
npm install postcss-ordered-values --save
```


## Example

Some CSS properties accept their values in an arbitrary order; for this reason,
it is entirely possible that different developers will write their values in
different orders. This module normalizes the order, making it easier for other
modules to understand which declarations are duplicates.

### Input

```css
h1 {
    border: solid 1px red;
    border: red solid .5em;
    border: rgba(0, 30, 105, 0.8) solid 1px;
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    border: 1px solid red;
    border: .5em solid red;
    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 30, 105, 0.8);
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```


## Support List

For more examples, see the [tests](src/__tests__/index.js).

* `border(border-left|right|top|bottom)`
* `box-shadow`
* `outline`
* `flex-flow`
* `transition`, `-webkit-transition`


## Usage

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for
examples for your environment.

&gt; Reduce [custom identifiers][idents] with PostCSS.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-reduce-idents) do:

```
npm install postcss-reduce-idents --save
```


## Example

### Input

This module will rename custom identifiers in your CSS files; it does so by
converting each name to a index, which is then encoded into a legal identifier.
A legal custom identifier in CSS is case sensitive and must start with a
letter, but can contain digits, hyphens and underscores. There are over 3,000
possible two character identifiers, and 51 possible single character identifiers
that will be generated.

```css
@keyframes whiteToBlack {
    0% {
        color: #fff
    }
    to {
        color: #000
    }
}

.one {
    animation-name: whiteToBlack
}
```

### Output

```css
@keyframes a {
    0% {
        color: #fff
    }
    to {
        color: #000
    }
}

.one {
    animation-name: a
}
```

Note that this module does not handle identifiers that are not linked together.
The following example will not be transformed in any way:

```css
@keyframes fadeOut {
    0% { opacity: 1 }
    to { opacity: 0 }
}

.fadeIn {
    animation-name: fadeIn;
}
```

It works for `@keyframes`, `@counter-style`, custom `counter` values and grid area definitions. See the
[documentation][idents] for more information, or the [tests](test.js) for more
examples.


## Usage

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for
examples for your environment.


## API

&gt; Reduce `initial` definitions to the *actual* initial value, where possible.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-reduce-initial) do:

```
npm install postcss-reduce-initial --save
```


## Example

This module will replace the `initial` CSS keyword with the *actual* value,
when this value is smaller than the `initial` definition itself. For example,
the initial value for the `min-width` property is `0`; therefore, these two
definitions are equivalent;

### Input

```css
h1 {
    min-width: initial;
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    min-width: 0;
}
```

&gt; Optimise inline SVG with PostCSS.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-svgo) do:

```
npm install postcss-svgo --save
```


## Example

### Input

```css
h1 {
    background: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; id=&quot;Layer_1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;&lt;circle cx=&quot;50&quot; cy=&quot;50&quot; r=&quot;40&quot; fill=&quot;yellow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;');
}
```

### Output

```css
h1 {
    background: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;circle cx=&quot;50&quot; cy=&quot;50&quot; r=&quot;40&quot; fill=&quot;%23ff0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;');
}
```


## API

### `svgo([options])`

Note that postcss-svgo is an *asynchronous* processor. It cannot be used
like this:

```js
var result = postcss([ svgo() ]).process(css).css;
console.log(result);
```

Instead make sure your PostCSS runner uses the asynchronous API:

```js
postcss([ svgo() ]).process(css).then(function (result) {
    console.log(result.css);
});
```

#### options

##### encode

Type: `boolean`
Default: `undefined`

If `true`, it will encode URL-unsafe characters such as `&lt;`, `&gt;` and `&amp;`;
`false` will decode these characters, and `undefined` will neither encode nor
decode the original input. Note that regardless of this setting, `#` will
always be URL-encoded.

##### plugins

Optionally, you can customise the output by specifying the `plugins` option. You
will need to provide the config in comma separated objects, like the example
below. Note that you can either disable the plugin by setting it to `false`,
or pass different options to change the default behaviour.

```js
var postcss = require('postcss');
var svgo = require('postcss-svgo');

var opts = {
    plugins: [{
        removeDoctype: false
    }, {
        removeComments: false
    }, {
        cleanupNumericValues: {
            floatPrecision: 2
        }
    }, {
        convertColors: {
            names2hex: false,
            rgb2hex: false
        }
    }]
};

postcss([ svgo(opts) ]).process(css).then(function (result) {
    console.log(result.css)
});
```

You can view the [full list of plugins here][plugins].

&gt; Reduce z-index values with PostCSS.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-zindex) do:

```
npm install postcss-zindex --save
```

## Example

Sometimes, you may introduce z-index values into your CSS that are larger than
necessary, in order to improve your understanding of how each stack relates to
the others. For example, you might have a modal overlay at `5000` and the dialog
for it at `5500` - so that modal classes occupy the `5xxx` space.

But in production, it is unnecessary to use such large values for z-index where
smaller values would suffice. This module will reduce all z-index declarations
whilst respecting your original intent; such that the overlay becomes `1` and
the dialog becomes `2`. For more examples, see the [tests](test.js).

### Input

```css
.modal {
    z-index: 5000
}

.modal-overlay {
    z-index: 5500
}
```

### Output

```css
.modal {
    z-index: 1
}

.modal-overlay {
    z-index: 2
}
```

Note that this module does not attempt to normalize relative z-index values,
such as `-1`; indeed, it will abort immediately when encountering these values
as it cannot be sure that rebasing mixed positive &amp; negative values will keep
the stacking context intact. Be careful with using this module alongside
JavaScript injected CSS; ideally you should have already extracted all of your
stacking context into CSS.

## API

### zindex([options])

#### options

##### startIndex

Type: `number`
Default: `1`

Set this to any other positive integer if you want to override z-indices from
other sources outside your control. For example if a third party widget has a
maximum z-index of `99`, you can set this to `100` and not have to worry about
stacking conflicts.

## Usage

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for
examples for your environment.

## Intro

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

### Input

&lt;!-- prettier-ignore --&gt;
```js
foo(reallyLongArg(), omgSoManyParameters(), IShouldRefactorThis(), isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne());
```

### Output

```js
foo(
  reallyLongArg(),
  omgSoManyParameters(),
  IShouldRefactorThis(),
  isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne()
);
```

Prettier can be run [in your editor](http://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) on-save, in a [pre-commit hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html), or in [CI environments](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#list-different) to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!

&gt; Call a callback-based function as ES6 Promise

## Installation

### NPM

```
npm install prominence
```

## API

- `prominenct(context: object): Prominence`
- `prominence(context: object, methodName: string, [ args: any[] ]): Promise&lt;any&gt;`

## Examples

ES6 Promise

```js
import fs from &quot;fs&quot;;
import prominence from &quot;prominence&quot;;

// use Prominence proxy
prominence(fs).readFile(filepath, &quot;utf-8&quot;).then((text) =&gt; {
  console.log(text);
}).catch(console.error.bind(console));

// not use a proxy
prominence(fs, &quot;readFile&quot;, [ filepath, &quot;utf-8&quot; ]).then((text) =&gt; {
  console.log(text);
}).catch(console.error.bind(console));
```

ES7 Async/Await

```js
import fs from &quot;fs&quot;;
import prominence from &quot;prominence&quot;;

// use Prominence Proxy
async (filepath) =&gt; {
  let text = await prominence(fs).readFile(filepath, &quot;utf-8&quot;);

  console.log(text);
};

A robust Punycode converter that fully complies to [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) and [RFC 5891](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891), and works on nearly all JavaScript platforms.

This JavaScript library is the result of comparing, optimizing and documenting different open-source implementations of the Punycode algorithm:

* [The C example code from RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492#appendix-C)
* [`punycode.c` by _Markus W. Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)
* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)
* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)

This project is [bundled](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/punycode.js) with [Node.js v0.6.2+](https://github.com/joyent/node/compare/975f1930b1...61e796decc).

## Installation

Via [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (only required for Node.js releases older than v0.6.2):

```bash

## API

### `punycode.decode(string)`

Converts a Punycode string of ASCII symbols to a string of Unicode symbols.

```js
// decode domain name parts
punycode.decode('maana-pta'); // 'mañana'
punycode.decode('--dqo34k'); // '☃-⌘'
```

### `punycode.encode(string)`

Converts a string of Unicode symbols to a Punycode string of ASCII symbols.

```js
// encode domain name parts
punycode.encode('mañana'); // 'maana-pta'
punycode.encode('☃-⌘'); // '--dqo34k'
```

### `punycode.toUnicode(input)`

Converts a Punycode string representing a domain name or an email address to Unicode. Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.

```js
// decode domain names
punycode.toUnicode('xn--maana-pta.com');
// → 'mañana.com'
punycode.toUnicode('xn----dqo34k.com');
// → '☃-⌘.com'

// decode email addresses
punycode.toUnicode('джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq');
// → 'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa'
```

### `punycode.toASCII(input)`

Converts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that's already in ASCII.

```js
// encode domain names
punycode.toASCII('mañana.com');
// → 'xn--maana-pta.com'
punycode.toASCII('☃-⌘.com');
// → 'xn----dqo34k.com'

// encode email addresses
punycode.toASCII('джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa');
// → 'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq'
```

### `punycode.ucs2`

#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`

Creates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.

```js
punycode.ucs2.decode('abc');
// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]
// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:
punycode.ucs2.decode('\uD834\uDF06');
// → [0x1D306]
```

#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`

Creates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.

```js
punycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);
// → 'abc'
punycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);
// → '\uD834\uDF06'
```

### `punycode.version`

A string representing the current Punycode.js version number.

## Unit tests &amp; code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

A robust Punycode converter that fully complies to [RFC 3492](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) and [RFC 5891](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891), and works on nearly all JavaScript platforms.

This JavaScript library is the result of comparing, optimizing and documenting different open-source implementations of the Punycode algorithm:

* [The C example code from RFC 3492](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492#appendix-C)
* [`punycode.c` by _Markus W. Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)
* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)
* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)

  Rate limiter for Node.js backed by Redis.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-ratelimiter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-ratelimiter)

## Release Notes
[v3.0.2](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v3.0.0) - [#33](/../../pull/33) by [@promag](https://github.com/promag) - Use sorted set to limit with moving window.

[v2.2.0](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.2.0) - [#30](/../../pull/30) by [@kp96](https://github.com/kp96) - Race condition when using `async.times`.

[v2.1.3](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.1.3) - [#22](/../../pull/22) by [@coderhaoxin](https://github.com/coderhaoxin) - Dev dependencies versions bump.

[v2.1.2](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.1.2) - [#17](/../../pull/17) by [@waleedsamy](https://github.com/waleedsamy) - Add Travis CI support.

[v2.1.1](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.1.1) - [#13](/../../pull/13) by [@kwizzn](https://github.com/kwizzn) - Fixes out-of-sync TTLs after running decr().

[v2.1.0](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.1.0) - [#12](/../../pull/12) by [@luin](https://github.com/luin) - Adding support for ioredis.

[v2.0.1](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.0.1) - [#9](/../../pull/9) by [@ruimarinho](https://github.com/ruimarinho) - Update redis commands to use array notation.

[v2.0.0](https://github.com/tj/node-ratelimiter/tree/v2.0.0) - **API CHANGE** - Change `remaining` to include current call instead of decreasing it. Decreasing caused an off-by-one problem and caller could not distinguish between last legit call and a rejected call.

## Requirements

- Redis 2.6.12+.

## Installation

```
$ npm install ratelimiter
```

## Example

 Example Connect middleware implementation limiting against a `user._id`:

```js
var id = req.user._id;
var limit = new Limiter({ id: id, db: db });
limit.get(function(err, limit){
  if (err) return next(err);

  res.set('X-RateLimit-Limit', limit.total);
  res.set('X-RateLimit-Remaining', limit.remaining - 1);
  res.set('X-RateLimit-Reset', limit.reset);

  // all good
  debug('remaining %s/%s %s', limit.remaining - 1, limit.total, id);
  if (limit.remaining) return next();

  // not good
  var delta = (limit.reset * 1000) - Date.now() | 0;
  var after = limit.reset - (Date.now() / 1000) | 0;
  res.set('Retry-After', after);
  res.send(429, 'Rate limit exceeded, retry in ' + ms(delta, { long: true }));
});
```

## Result Object
 - `total` - `max` value
 - `remaining` - number of calls left in current `duration` without decreasing current `get`
 - `reset` - time in milliseconds until the end of current `duration`

## Options

 - `id` - the identifier to limit against (typically a user id)
 - `db` - redis connection instance
 - `max` - max requests within `duration` [2500]
 - `duration` - of limit in milliseconds [3600000]

_Regenerate_ is a Unicode-aware regex generator for JavaScript. It allows you to easily generate ES5-compatible regular expressions based on a given set of Unicode symbols or code points. (This is trickier than you might think, because of [how JavaScript deals with astral symbols](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode).)

## Installation

Via [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

```bash
npm install regenerate
```

Via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install regenerate
```

Via [Component](https://github.com/component/component):

```bash
component install mathiasbynens/regenerate
```

In a browser:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;regenerate.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [io.js](https://iojs.org/), and [RingoJS ≥ v0.8.0](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var regenerate = require('regenerate');
```

In [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) and [RingoJS ≤ v0.7.0](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var regenerate = require('regenerate').regenerate;
```

In [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):

```js
load('regenerate.js');
```

Using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):

```js
require(
  {
    'paths': {
      'regenerate': 'path/to/regenerate'
    }
  },
  ['regenerate'],
  function(regenerate) {
    console.log(regenerate);
  }
);
```

## API

### `regenerate(value1, value2, value3, ...)`

The main Regenerate function. Calling this function creates a new set that gets a chainable API.

```js
var set = regenerate()
  .addRange(0x60, 0x69) // add U+0060 to U+0069
  .remove(0x62, 0x64) // remove U+0062 and U+0064
  .add(0x1D306); // add U+1D306
set.valueOf();
// → [0x60, 0x61, 0x63, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69, 0x1D306]
set.toString();
// → '[`ace-i]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
set.toRegExp();
// → /[`ace-i]|\uD834\uDF06/
```

Any arguments passed to `regenerate()` will be added to the set right away. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted, as well as arrays containing values of these types.

```js
regenerate(0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'

var items = [0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603];
regenerate(items).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.add(value1, value2, value3, ...)`

Any arguments passed to `add()` are added to the set. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted, as well as arrays containing values of these types.

```js
regenerate().add(0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'

var items = [0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603];
regenerate().add(items).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

It’s also possible to pass in a Regenerate instance. Doing so adds all code points in that instance to the current set.

```js
var set = regenerate(0x1D306, 'A');
regenerate().add('©', 0x2603).add(set).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

Note that the initial call to `regenerate()` acts like `add()`. This allows you to create a new Regenerate instance and add some code points to it in one go:

```js
regenerate(0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9\\u2603]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.remove(value1, value2, value3, ...)`

Any arguments passed to `remove()` are removed to the set. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted, as well as arrays containing values of these types.

```js
regenerate(0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603).remove('☃').toString();
// → '[A\\xA9]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

It’s also possible to pass in a Regenerate instance. Doing so removes all code points in that instance from the current set.

```js
var set = regenerate('☃');
regenerate(0x1D306, 'A', '©', 0x2603).remove(set).toString();
// → '[A\\xA9]|\\uD834\\uDF06'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.addRange(start, end)`

Adds a range of code points from `start` to `end` (inclusive) to the set. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted.

```js
regenerate(0x1D306).addRange(0x00, 0xFF).toString(16);
// → '[\\0-\\xFF]|\\uD834\\uDF06'

regenerate().addRange('A', 'z').toString();
// → '[A-z]'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.removeRange(start, end)`

Removes a range of code points from `start` to `end` (inclusive) from the set. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted.

```js
regenerate()
  .addRange(0x000000, 0x10FFFF) // add all Unicode code points
  .removeRange('A', 'z') // remove all symbols from `A` to `z`
  .toString();
// → '[\\0-@\\{-\\uD7FF\\uE000-\\uFFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF](?![\\uDC00-\\uDFFF])|(?:[^\\uD800-\\uDBFF]|^)[\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]'

regenerate()
  .addRange(0x000000, 0x10FFFF) // add all Unicode code points
  .removeRange(0x0041, 0x007A) // remove all code points from U+0041 to U+007A
  .toString();
// → '[\\0-@\\{-\\uD7FF\\uE000-\\uFFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF](?![\\uDC00-\\uDFFF])|(?:[^\\uD800-\\uDBFF]|^)[\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.intersection(codePoints)`

Removes any code points from the set that are not present in both the set and the given `codePoints` array. `codePoints` must be an array of numeric code point values, i.e. numbers.

```js
regenerate()
  .addRange(0x00, 0xFF) // add extended ASCII code points
  .intersection([0x61, 0x69]) // remove all code points from the set except for these
  .toString();
// → '[ai]'
```

Instead of the `codePoints` array, it’s also possible to pass in a Regenerate instance.

```js
var whitelist = regenerate(0x61, 0x69);

regenerate()
  .addRange(0x00, 0xFF) // add extended ASCII code points
  .intersection(whitelist) // remove all code points from the set except for those in the `whitelist` set
  .toString();
// → '[ai]'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.contains(value)`

Returns `true` if the given value is part of the set, and `false` otherwise. Both code points (numbers) and symbols (strings consisting of a single Unicode symbol) are accepted.

```js
var set = regenerate().addRange(0x00, 0xFF);
set.contains('A');
// → true
set.contains(0x1D306);
// → false
```

### `regenerate.prototype.clone()`

Returns a clone of the current code point set. Any actions performed on the clone won’t mutate the original set.

```js
var setA = regenerate(0x1D306);
var setB = setA.clone().add(0x1F4A9);
setA.toArray();
// → [0x1D306]
setB.toArray();
// → [0x1D306, 0x1F4A9]
```

### `regenerate.prototype.toString(options)`

Returns a string representing (part of) a regular expression that matches all the symbols mapped to the code points within the set.

```js
regenerate(0x1D306, 0x1F4A9).toString();
// → '\\uD834\\uDF06|\\uD83D\\uDCA9'
```

If the `bmpOnly` property of the optional `options` object is set to `true`, the output matches surrogates individually, regardless of whether they’re lone surrogates or just part of a surrogate pair. This simplifies the output, but it can only be used in case you’re certain the strings it will be used on don’t contain any astral symbols.

```js
var highSurrogates = regenerate().addRange(0xD800, 0xDBFF);
highSurrogates.toString();
// → '[\\uD800-\\uDBFF](?![\\uDC00-\\uDFFF])'
highSurrogates.toString({ 'bmpOnly': true });
// → '[\\uD800-\\uDBFF]'

var lowSurrogates = regenerate().addRange(0xDC00, 0xDFFF);
lowSurrogates.toString();
// → '(?:[^\\uD800-\\uDBFF]|^)[\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]'
lowSurrogates.toString({ 'bmpOnly': true });
// → '[\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]'
```

Note that lone low surrogates cannot be matched accurately using regular expressions in JavaScript. Regenerate’s output makes a best-effort approach but [there can be false negatives in this regard](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regenerate/issues/28#issuecomment-72224808).

If the `hasUnicodeFlag` property of the optional `options` object is set to `true`, the output makes use of Unicode code point escapes (`\u{…}`) where applicable. This simplifies the output at the cost of compatibility and portability, since it means the output can only be used as a pattern in a regular expression with [the ES6 `u` flag](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex) enabled.

```js
var set = regenerate().addRange(0x0, 0x10FFFF);

set.toString();
// → '[\\0-\\uD7FF\\uE000-\\uFFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF](?![\\uDC00-\\uDFFF])|(?:[^\\uD800-\\uDBFF]|^)[\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]''

set.toString({ 'hasUnicodeFlag': true });
// → '[\\0-\\u{10FFFF}]'
```

### `regenerate.prototype.toRegExp(flags = '')`

Returns a regular expression that matches all the symbols mapped to the code points within the set. Optionally, you can pass [flags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#Parameters) to be added to the regular expression.

```js
var regex = regenerate(0x1D306, 0x1F4A9).toRegExp();
// → /\uD834\uDF06|\uD83D\uDCA9/
regex.test('𝌆');
// → true
regex.test('A');
// → false

// With flags:
var regex = regenerate(0x1D306, 0x1F4A9).toRegExp('g');
// → /\uD834\uDF06|\uD83D\uDCA9/g
```

**Note:** This probably shouldn’t be used. Regenerate is intended as a tool that is used as part of a build process, not at runtime.

### `regenerate.prototype.valueOf()` or `regenerate.prototype.toArray()`

Returns a sorted array of unique code points in the set.

```js
regenerate(0x1D306)
  .addRange(0x60, 0x65)
  .add(0x59, 0x60) // note: 0x59 is added after 0x65, and 0x60 is a duplicate
  .valueOf();
// → [0x59, 0x60, 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64, 0x65, 0x1D306]
```

### `regenerate.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

## Combine Regenerate with other libraries

Regenerate gets even better when combined with other libraries such as [Punycode.js](https://mths.be/punycode). Here’s an example where [Punycode.js](https://mths.be/punycode) is used to convert a string into an array of code points, that is then passed on to Regenerate:

```js
var regenerate = require('regenerate');
var punycode = require('punycode');

var string = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.';
// Get an array of all code points used in the string:
var codePoints = punycode.ucs2.decode(string);

// Generate a regular expression that matches any of the symbols used in the string:
regenerate(codePoints).toString();
// → '[ \\.Ladeilmopr-u]'
```

In ES6 you can do something similar with [`Array.from`](https://mths.be/array-from) which uses [the string’s iterator](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode#iterating-over-symbols) to split the given string into an array of strings that each contain a single symbol. [`regenerate()`](#regenerateprototypeaddvalue1-value2-value3-) accepts both strings and code points, remember?

```js
var regenerate = require('regenerate');

var string = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.';
// Get an array of all symbols used in the string:
var symbols = Array.from(string);

// Generate a regular expression that matches any of the symbols used in the string:
regenerate(symbols).toString();
// → '[ \\.Ladeilmopr-u]'
```

## Support

Regenerate supports at least Chrome 27+, Firefox 3+, Safari 4+, Opera 10+, IE 6+, Node.js v0.10.0+, io.js v1.0.0+, Narwhal 0.3.2+, RingoJS 0.8+, PhantomJS 1.9.0+, and Rhino 1.7RC4+.

## Unit tests &amp; code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for Regenerate development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.

_regexpu_ is a source code transpiler that enables the use of ES6 Unicode regular expressions in JavaScript-of-today (ES5).

_regexpu-core_ contains _regexpu_’s core functionality, i.e. `rewritePattern(pattern, flag)`, which enables rewriting regular expressions that make use of [the ES6 `u` flag](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex) into equivalent ES5-compatible regular expression patterns.

## Installation

To use _regexpu-core_ programmatically, install it as a dependency via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install regexpu-core --save-dev
```

Then, `require` it:

```js
const rewritePattern = require('regexpu-core');
```

## API

This module exports a single function named `rewritePattern`.

### `rewritePattern(pattern, flags)`

This function takes a string that represents a regular expression pattern as well as a string representing its flags, and returns an ES5-compatible version of the pattern.

```js
rewritePattern('foo.bar', 'u');
// → 'foo(?:[\\0-\\t\\x0B\\f\\x0E-\\u2027\\u202A-\\uD7FF\\uDC00-\\uFFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF])bar'

rewritePattern('[\\u{1D306}-\\u{1D308}a-z]', 'u');
// → '(?:[a-z]|\\uD834[\\uDF06-\\uDF08])'

rewritePattern('[\\u{1D306}-\\u{1D308}a-z]', 'ui');
// → '(?:[a-z\\u017F\\u212A]|\\uD834[\\uDF06-\\uDF08])'
```

_regexpu-core_ can rewrite non-ES6 regular expressions too, which is useful to demonstrate how their behavior changes once the `u` and `i` flags are added:

```js
// In ES5, the dot operator only matches BMP symbols:
rewritePattern('foo.bar');
// → 'foo(?:[\\0-\\t\\x0B\\f\\x0E-\\u2027\\u202A-\\uFFFF])bar'

// But with the ES6 `u` flag, it matches astral symbols too:
rewritePattern('foo.bar', 'u');
// → 'foo(?:[\\0-\\t\\x0B\\f\\x0E-\\u2027\\u202A-\\uD7FF\\uDC00-\\uFFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]|[\\uD800-\\uDBFF])bar'
```

`rewritePattern` uses [regjsgen](https://github.com/d10/regjsgen), [regjsparser](https://github.com/jviereck/regjsparser), and [regenerate](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regenerate) as internal dependencies.

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii &lt; 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value &gt;= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.</pre></section></details><details><summary>rx-lite-aggregates@4.0.8</summary><section><h3>rx-lite-aggregates@4.0.8</h3><pre># RxJS Aggregates Module #

The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript has a number of aggregation operators including those you might already know from the Array#extras and the upcoming ES6 standard such as `reduce`, `find` and `findIndex`.  This module is used exclusively for aggregation operations used on finite observable sequences.  In addition to the aforementioned operators, there are many useful operators such as `count`, `sum`, `average` and determining whether two sequences are equal via the `sequenceEqual` method.  This requires `rx.lite.js` from the [`rx-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-lite) NPM module.

## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.

### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash`
$ npm install rx-lite-aggregates
$ npm install -g rx-lite-aggregates
```

### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js

```js
var Rx = require('rx-lite-aggregates');
```

### In a Browser:

```html
&lt;!-- Just the core RxJS --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/rx.lite.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/rx.lite.aggregates.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript Lite version is a lightweight version of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which covers most of the day to day operators you might use all in a single library.  Functionality such as bridging to events, promises, callbacks, Node.js-style callbacks, time-based operations and more are built right in.  This comes with `rx.lite.js` which is for use in modern development environments such as &gt; IE9 and server-side environments such as Node.js.

## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.

### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash`
$ npm install rx-lite
$ npm install -g rx-lite
```

### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js

```js
var Rx = require('rx-lite');
```

### In a Browser:

```html
&lt;!-- Just the core RxJS --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/rx.lite.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/seedrandom.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/seedrandom)

Seeded random number generator for JavaScript.

Version 2.4.2

Author: David Bau

Date: 2015-07-04

Can be used as a plain script, a Node.js module or an AMD module.


Script tag usage
----------------

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/2.4.0/seedrandom.min.js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```js
// Sets Math.random to a PRNG initialized using the given explicit seed.
Math.seedrandom('hello.');
console.log(Math.random());          // Always 0.9282578795792454
console.log(Math.random());          // Always 0.3752569768646784

// Sets Math.random to an ARC4-based PRNG that is autoseeded using the
// current time, dom state, and other accumulated local entropy.
// The generated seed string is returned.
Math.seedrandom();
console.log(Math.random());          // Reasonably unpredictable.

// Seeds using the given explicit seed mixed with accumulated entropy.
Math.seedrandom('added entropy.', { entropy: true });
console.log(Math.random());          // As unpredictable as added entropy.

// Use &quot;new&quot; to create a local prng without altering Math.random.
var myrng = new Math.seedrandom('hello.');
console.log(myrng());                // Always 0.9282578795792454

// Use &quot;quick&quot; to get only 32 bits of randomness in a float.
console.log(myrng.quick());          // Always 0.3752569768112153

// Use &quot;int32&quot; to get a 32 bit (signed) integer
console.log(myrng.int32());          // Always 986220731

```

Other Fast PRNG Algorithms
--------------------------

The package includes some other fast PRNGs.  To use Richard Brent's
xorgens-4096 PRNG:


```html
&lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/2.4.0/lib/xor4096.min.js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```js
// Use xor4096 for Richard Brent's xorgens-4096 algorithm.
var xorgen = new xor4096('hello.');

// By default provides 32 bits of randomness in a float.
console.log(xorgen());               // Always 0.9798525865189731

// Use &quot;double&quot; to get 56 bits of randomness.
console.log(xorgen.double());        // Always 0.03583478477375346

// Use &quot;int32&quot; to get a 32 bit (signed) integer.
console.log(xorgen.int32());         // Always 1341429986
````

Besides xor4096, there are several other faster PRNGs available.

|PRNG name  | Time vs native | Period      | Author               |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
|`alea`     |  1.95 ns, 0.9x | ~2^116      | Baagoe               |
|`xor128`   |  2.04 ns, 0.9x | 2^128-1     | Marsaglia            |
|`tychei`   |  2.32 ns, 1.1x | ~2^127      | Neves/Araujo (ChaCha)|
|`xorwow`   |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^192-2^32  | Marsaglia            |
|`xor4096`  |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^4096-2^32 | Brent (xorgens)      |
|`xorshift7`|  2.64 ns, 1.3x | 2^256-1     | Panneton/L'ecuyer    |
|`quick`    |  3.80 ns, 1.8x | ~2^1600     | Bau (ARC4)           |

(Timings were done on node v0.12.2 on a single-core Google Compute Engine
instance.  `quick` is just the 32-bit version of the RC4-based PRNG
originally packaged with seedrandom.)


Node.js usage
-------------

```
npm install seedrandom
```

```js
// Local PRNG: does not affect Math.random.
var seedrandom = require('seedrandom');
var rng = seedrandom('hello.');
console.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454

// Global PRNG: set Math.random.
seedrandom('hello.', { global: true });
console.log(Math.random());          // Always 0.9282578795792454

// Autoseeded ARC4-based PRNG.
rng = seedrandom();
console.log(rng());                  // Reasonably unpredictable.

// Mixing accumulated entropy.
rng = seedrandom('added entropy.', { entropy: true });
console.log(rng());                  // As unpredictable as added entropy.

// Using alternate algorithms, as listed above.
var rng2 = seedrandom.xor4096('hello.')
console.log(rng2());
```


Require.js usage
----------------

Similar to Node.js usage:

```
bower install seedrandom
```

```
require(['seedrandom'], function(seedrandom) {
  var rng = seedrandom('hello.');
  console.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454
});
```


Network seeding
---------------

```html
&lt;script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/2.4.0/seedrandom.min.js&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Seeds using urandom bits from a server. --&gt;
&lt;script src=//jsonlib.appspot.com/urandom?callback=Math.seedrandom&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Seeds mixing in random.org bits --&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
(function(x, u, s){
  try {
    // Make a synchronous request to random.org.
    x.open('GET', u, false);
    x.send();
    s = unescape(x.response.trim().replace(/^|\s/g, '%'));
  } finally {
    // Seed with the response, or autoseed on failure.
    Math.seedrandom(s, !!s);
  }
})(new XMLHttpRequest, 'https://www.random.org/integers/' +
  '?num=256&amp;min=0&amp;max=255&amp;col=1&amp;base=16&amp;format=plain&amp;rnd=new');
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Reseeding using user input
--------------------------

```js
var seed = Math.seedrandom();        // Use prng with an automatic seed.
document.write(Math.random());       // Pretty much unpredictable x.

var rng = new Math.seedrandom(seed); // A new prng with the same seed.
document.write(rng());               // Repeat the 'unpredictable' x.

function reseed(event, count) {      // Define a custom entropy collector.
  var t = [];
  function w(e) {
    t.push([e.pageX, e.pageY, +new Date]);
    if (t.length &lt; count) { return; }
    document.removeEventListener(event, w);
    Math.seedrandom(t, { entropy: true });
  }
  document.addEventListener(event, w);
}
reseed('mousemove', 100);            // Reseed after 100 mouse moves.
```

The &quot;pass&quot; option can be used to get both the prng and the seed.
The following returns both an autoseeded prng and the seed as an object,
without mutating Math.random:

```js
var obj = Math.seedrandom(null, { pass: function(prng, seed) {
  return { random: prng, seed: seed };
}});
```


Saving and Restoring PRNG state
-------------------------------

```js
var seedrandom = Math.seedrandom;
var saveable = seedrandom(&quot;secret-seed&quot;, {state: true});
for (var j = 0; j &lt; 1e5; ++j) saveable();
var saved = saveable.state();
var replica = seedrandom(&quot;&quot;, {state: saved});
assert(replica() == saveable());
```

In normal use the prng is opaque and its internal state cannot be accessed.
However, if the &quot;state&quot; option is specified, the prng gets a state() method
that returns a plain object the can be used to reconstruct a prng later in
the same state (by passing that saved object back as the state option).


Version notes
-------------

The random number sequence is the same as version 1.0 for string seeds.

* Version 2.0 changed the sequence for non-string seeds.
* Version 2.1 speeds seeding and uses window.crypto to autoseed if present.
* Version 2.2 alters non-crypto autoseeding to sweep up entropy from plugins.
* Version 2.3 adds support for &quot;new&quot;, module loading, and a null seed arg.
* Version 2.3.1 adds a build environment, module packaging, and tests.
* Version 2.3.4 fixes bugs on IE8, and switches to MIT license.
* Version 2.3.6 adds a readable options object argument.
* Version 2.3.10 adds support for node.js crypto (contributed by ctd1500).
* Version 2.3.11 adds an option to load and save internal state.
* Version 2.4.0 adds implementations of several other fast PRNGs.
* Version 2.4.2 adds an implementation of Baagoe's very fast Alea PRNG.

The standard ARC4 key scheduler cycles short keys, which means that
seedrandom('ab') is equivalent to seedrandom('abab') and 'ababab'.
Therefore it is a good idea to add a terminator to avoid trivial
equivalences on short string seeds, e.g., Math.seedrandom(str + '\0').
Starting with version 2.0, a terminator is added automatically for
non-string seeds, so seeding with the number 111 is the same as seeding
with '111\0'.

When seedrandom() is called with zero args or a null seed, it uses a
seed drawn from the browser crypto object if present.  If there is no
crypto support, seedrandom() uses the current time, the native rng,
and a walk of several DOM objects to collect a few bits of entropy.

Each time the one- or two-argument forms of seedrandom are called,
entropy from the passed seed is accumulated in a pool to help generate
future seeds for the zero- and two-argument forms of seedrandom.

On speed - This javascript implementation of Math.random() is several
times slower than the built-in Math.random() because it is not native
code, but that is typically fast enough.  Some details (timings on
Chrome 25 on a 2010 vintage macbook):

* seeded Math.random()          - avg less than 0.0002 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom('explicit.')       - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom('explicit.', true) - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom() with crypto      - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call

Autoseeding without crypto is somewhat slow, about 20-30 milliseconds on
a 2012 windows 7 1.5ghz i5 laptop, as seen on Firefox 19, IE 10, and Opera.
Seeded rng calls themselves are fast across these browsers, with slowest
numbers on Opera at about 0.0005 ms per seeded Math.random().

console.log(xorgen());               // Always 0.9798525865189731

// Use &quot;double&quot; to get 56 bits of randomness.

console.log(xorgen.int32());         // Always 1341429986
````

Besides xor4096, there are several other faster PRNGs available.

|PRNG name  | Time vs native | Period      | Author               |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
|`alea`     |  1.95 ns, 0.9x | ~2^116      | Baagøe               |
|`xor128`   |  2.04 ns, 0.9x | 2^128-1     | Marsaglia            |
|`tychei`   |  2.32 ns, 1.1x | ~2^127      | Neves/Araujo (ChaCha)|
|`xorwow`   |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^192-2^32  | Marsaglia            |
|`xor4096`  |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^4096-2^32 | Brent (xorgens)      |
|`xorshift7`|  2.64 ns, 1.3x | 2^256-1     | Panneton/L'ecuyer    |
|`quick`    |  3.80 ns, 1.8x | ~2^1600     | Bau (ARC4)           |

(Timings were done on node v0.12.2 on a single-core Google Compute Engine
instance.  `quick` is just the 32-bit version of the RC4-based PRNG
originally packaged with seedrandom.)


Node.js usage
-------------

```
npm install seedrandom
```

```js
// Local PRNG: does not affect Math.random.
var seedrandom = require('seedrandom');
var rng = seedrandom('hello.');
console.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454

// Global PRNG: set Math.random.
seedrandom('hello.', { global: true });
console.log(Math.random());          // Always 0.9282578795792454

// Autoseeded ARC4-based PRNG.
rng = seedrandom();
console.log(rng());                  // Reasonably unpredictable.

// Mixing accumulated entropy.
rng = seedrandom('added entropy.', { entropy: true });
console.log(rng());                  // As unpredictable as added entropy.

// Using alternate algorithms, as listed above.
var rng2 = seedrandom.xor4096('hello.')
console.log(rng2());
```


Require.js usage
----------------

Similar to Node.js usage:

```
bower install seedrandom
```

```
require(['seedrandom'], function(seedrandom) {
  var rng = seedrandom('hello.');
  console.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454
});
```


Network seeding
---------------

```html
&lt;script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/2.4.3/seedrandom.min.js&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Seeds using urandom bits from a server. --&gt;
&lt;script src=//jsonlib.appspot.com/urandom?callback=Math.seedrandom&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Seeds mixing in random.org bits --&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
(function(x, u, s){
  try {
    // Make a synchronous request to random.org.
    x.open('GET', u, false);
    x.send();
    s = unescape(x.response.trim().replace(/^|\s/g, '%'));
  } finally {
    // Seed with the response, or autoseed on failure.
    Math.seedrandom(s, !!s);
  }
})(new XMLHttpRequest, 'https://www.random.org/integers/' +
  '?num=256&amp;min=0&amp;max=255&amp;col=1&amp;base=16&amp;format=plain&amp;rnd=new');
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Reseeding using user input
--------------------------

```js
var seed = Math.seedrandom();        // Use prng with an automatic seed.
document.write(Math.random());       // Pretty much unpredictable x.

var rng = new Math.seedrandom(seed); // A new prng with the same seed.
document.write(rng());               // Repeat the 'unpredictable' x.

function reseed(event, count) {      // Define a custom entropy collector.
  var t = [];
  function w(e) {
    t.push([e.pageX, e.pageY, +new Date]);
    if (t.length &lt; count) { return; }
    document.removeEventListener(event, w);
    Math.seedrandom(t, { entropy: true });
  }
  document.addEventListener(event, w);
}
reseed('mousemove', 100);            // Reseed after 100 mouse moves.
```

The &quot;pass&quot; option can be used to get both the prng and the seed.
The following returns both an autoseeded prng and the seed as an object,
without mutating Math.random:

```js
var obj = Math.seedrandom(null, { pass: function(prng, seed) {
  return { random: prng, seed: seed };
}});
```


Saving and Restoring PRNG state
-------------------------------

```js
var seedrandom = Math.seedrandom;
var saveable = seedrandom(&quot;secret-seed&quot;, {state: true});
for (var j = 0; j &lt; 1e5; ++j) saveable();
var saved = saveable.state();
var replica = seedrandom(&quot;&quot;, {state: saved});
assert(replica() == saveable());
```

In normal use the prng is opaque and its internal state cannot be accessed.
However, if the &quot;state&quot; option is specified, the prng gets a state() method
that returns a plain object the can be used to reconstruct a prng later in
the same state (by passing that saved object back as the state option).


Version notes
-------------

The random number sequence is the same as version 1.0 for string seeds.

* Version 2.0 changed the sequence for non-string seeds.
* Version 2.1 speeds seeding and uses window.crypto to autoseed if present.
* Version 2.2 alters non-crypto autoseeding to sweep up entropy from plugins.
* Version 2.3 adds support for &quot;new&quot;, module loading, and a null seed arg.
* Version 2.3.1 adds a build environment, module packaging, and tests.
* Version 2.3.4 fixes bugs on IE8, and switches to MIT license.
* Version 2.3.6 adds a readable options object argument.
* Version 2.3.10 adds support for node.js crypto (contributed by ctd1500).
* Version 2.3.11 adds an option to load and save internal state.
* Version 2.4.0 adds implementations of several other fast PRNGs.
* Version 2.4.2 adds an implementation of Baagoe's very fast Alea PRNG.
* Version 2.4.3 ignores nodejs crypto when under browserify.

The standard ARC4 key scheduler cycles short keys, which means that
seedrandom('ab') is equivalent to seedrandom('abab') and 'ababab'.
Therefore it is a good idea to add a terminator to avoid trivial
equivalences on short string seeds, e.g., Math.seedrandom(str + '\0').
Starting with version 2.0, a terminator is added automatically for
non-string seeds, so seeding with the number 111 is the same as seeding
with '111\0'.

When seedrandom() is called with zero args or a null seed, it uses a
seed drawn from the browser crypto object if present.  If there is no
crypto support, seedrandom() uses the current time, the native rng,
and a walk of several DOM objects to collect a few bits of entropy.

Each time the one- or two-argument forms of seedrandom are called,
entropy from the passed seed is accumulated in a pool to help generate
future seeds for the zero- and two-argument forms of seedrandom.

On speed - This javascript implementation of Math.random() is several
times slower than the built-in Math.random() because it is not native
code, but that is typically fast enough.  Some details (timings on
Chrome 25 on a 2010 vintage macbook):

* seeded Math.random()          - avg less than 0.0002 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom('explicit.')       - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom('explicit.', true) - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call
* seedrandom() with crypto      - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call

Autoseeding without crypto is somewhat slow, about 20-30 milliseconds on
a 2012 windows 7 1.5ghz i5 laptop, as seen on Firefox 19, IE 10, and Opera.
Seeded rng calls themselves are fast across these browsers, with slowest
numbers on Opera at about 0.0005 ms per seeded Math.random().

[![Build Status][1]][2] [![dependency status][3]][4] [![dev dependency status][5]][6]

`seek-bzip` is a pure-javascript Node.JS module adapted from [node-bzip](https://github.com/skeggse/node-bzip) and before that [antimatter15's pure-javascript bzip2 decoder](https://github.com/antimatter15/bzip2.js).  Like these projects, `seek-bzip` only does decompression (see [compressjs](https://github.com/cscott/compressjs) if you need compression code).  Unlike those other projects, `seek-bzip` can seek to and decode single blocks from the bzip2 file.

`seek-bzip` primarily decodes buffers into other buffers, synchronously.
With the help of the [fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers)
package, it can operate on node streams; see `test/stream.js` for an
example.

## How to Install

```
npm install seek-bzip
```

This package uses
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays), which are present in node.js &gt;= 0.5.5.

## Usage

After compressing some example data into `example.bz2`, the following will recreate that original data and save it to `example`:

```
var Bunzip = require('seek-bzip');
var fs = require('fs');

var compressedData = fs.readFileSync('example.bz2');
var data = Bunzip.decode(compressedData);

fs.writeFileSync('example', data);
```

See the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.

For uncompressing single blocks of bzip2-compressed data, you will need
an out-of-band index listing the start of each bzip2 block.  (Presumably
you generate this at the same time as you index the start of the information
you wish to seek to inside the compressed file.)  The `seek-bzip` module
has been designed to be compatible with the C implementation `seek-bzip2`
available from https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2.  That codebase
contains a `bzip-table` tool which will generate bzip2 block start indices.
There is also a pure-JavaScript `seek-bzip-table` tool in this package's
`bin` directory.

## Documentation

`require('seek-bzip')` returns a `Bunzip` object.  It contains three static
methods.  The first is a function accepting one or two parameters:

`Bunzip.decode = function(input, [Number expectedSize] or [output], [boolean multistream])`

The `input` argument can be a &quot;stream&quot; object (which must implement the
`readByte` method), or a `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is not present, `decodeBzip` simply decodes `input` and
returns the resulting `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is present (and numeric), `decodeBzip` will store
the results in a `Buffer` of length `expectedSize`, and throw an error
in the case that the size of the decoded data does not match
`expectedSize`.

If you pass a non-numeric second parameter, it can either be a `Buffer`
object (which must be of the correct length; an error will be thrown if
the size of the decoded data does not match the buffer length) or
a &quot;stream&quot; object (which must implement a `writeByte` method).

The optional third `multistream` parameter, if true, attempts to continue
reading past the end of the bzip2 file.  This supports &quot;multistream&quot;
bzip2 files, which are simply multiple bzip2 files concatenated together.
If this argument is true, the input stream must have an `eof` method
which returns true when the end of the input has been reached.

The second exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.decodeBlock = function(input, Number blockStartBits, [Number expectedSize] or [output])`

The `input` and `expectedSize`/`output` parameters are as above.
The `blockStartBits` parameter gives the start of the desired block, in bits.

If passing a stream as the `input` parameter, it must implement the
`seek` method.

The final exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.table = function(input, Function callback, [boolean multistream])`

The `input` and `multistream` parameters are identical to those for the
`decode` method.

This function will invoke `callback(position, size)` once per bzip2 block,
where `position` gives the starting position of the block (in *bits*), and
`size` gives the uncompressed size of the block (in bytes).

This can be used to construct an index allowing direct access to a particular
block inside a bzip2 file, using the `decodeBlock` method.

## Command-line
There are binaries available in bin.  The first generates an index of all
the blocks in a bzip2-compressed file:
```
$ bin/seek-bzip-table test/sample4.bz2
32	99981
320555	99981
606348	99981
847568	99981
1089094	99981
1343625	99981
1596228	99981
1843336	99981
2090919	99981
2342106	39019
$
```
The first field is the starting position of the block, in bits, and the
second field is the length of the block, in bytes.

The second binary decodes an arbitrary block of a bzip2 file:
```
$ bin/seek-bunzip -d -b 2342106 test/sample4.bz2 | tail
élan's
émigré
émigré's
émigrés
épée
épée's
épées
étude
étude's

$
```

&gt; Regular expression for matching [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) versions


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save semver-regex
```


## Usage

```js
var semverRegex = require('semver-regex');

semverRegex().test('v1.0.0');
//=&gt; true

semverRegex().test('1.2.3-alpha.10.beta.0+build.unicorn.rainbow');
//=&gt; true

semverRegex().exec('unicorn 1.0.0 rainbow')[0];
//=&gt; 1.0.0

'unicorn 1.0.0 and rainbow 2.1.3'.match(semverRegex());
//=&gt; ['1.0.0', '2.1.3']
```

*It's a function so you can create multiple instances. Regexes with the global flag will have the `.lastIndex` property changed for each call to methods on the instance. Therefore reusing the instance with multiple calls will not work as expected for `.test()`.*

&gt; Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`

[Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.

This was created since the `path` methods in Node outputs `\\` paths on Windows.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save slash
```


## Usage

```js
var path = require('path');
var slash = require('slash');

var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
// Unix    =&gt; foo/bar
// Windows =&gt; foo\\bar

slash(str);
// Unix    =&gt; foo/bar
// Windows =&gt; foo/bar
```


## API

### slash(path)

Type: `string`

Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.

&lt;br/&gt;

### Install

Via npm

```bash
$ npm install sortablejs --save
```

Via bower:

```bash
$ bower install --save sortablejs
```

&lt;br/&gt;

### Usage
```html
&lt;ul id=&quot;items&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```js
var el = document.getElementById('items');
var sortable = Sortable.create(el);
```

You can use any element for the list and its elements, not just `ul`/`li`. Here is an [example with `div`s](http://jsbin.com/qumuwe/edit?html,js,output).

		var cloneEl = evt.clone;
	}
});
```

#### `group` option
To drag elements from one list into another, both lists must have the same `group` value.
You can also define whether lists can give away, give and keep a copy (`clone`), and receive elements.

 * name: `String` — group name
 * pull: `true|false|'clone'|function` — ability to move from the list. `clone` — copy the item, rather than move.
 * put: `true|false|[&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]|function` — whether elements can be added from other lists, or an array of group names from which elements can be taken.
 * revertClone: `boolean` — revert cloned element to initial position after moving to a another list.


Demo:
 - http://jsbin.com/naduvo/edit?js,output
 - http://jsbin.com/rusuvot/edit?js,output — use of complex logic in the `pull` and` put`
 - http://jsbin.com/magogub/edit?js,output — use `revertClone: true`


---


#### `sort` option
Sorting inside list.

Demo: http://jsbin.com/videzob/edit?html,js,output


---


#### `delay` option
Time in milliseconds to define when the sorting should start.

Demo: http://jsbin.com/xizeh/edit?html,js,output


---


#### `disabled` options
Disables the sortable if set to `true`.

Demo: http://jsbin.com/xiloqu/edit?html,js,output

```js
var sortable = Sortable.create(list);

document.getElementById(&quot;switcher&quot;).onclick = function () {
	var state = sortable.option(&quot;disabled&quot;); // get

	sortable.option(&quot;disabled&quot;, !state); // set
};
```


---


#### `handle` option
To make list items draggable, Sortable disables text selection by the user.
That's not always desirable. To allow text selection, define a drag handler,
which is an area of every list element that allows it to be dragged around.

Demo: http://jsbin.com/newize/edit?html,js,output

```js
Sortable.create(el, {
	handle: &quot;.my-handle&quot;
});
```

```html
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;my-handle&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; list item text one
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;my-handle&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; list item text two
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```css
.my-handle {
	cursor: move;
	cursor: -webkit-grabbing;
}
```


---


#### `filter` option


```js
Sortable.create(list, {
	filter: &quot;.js-remove, .js-edit&quot;,
	onFilter: function (evt) {
		var item = evt.item,
			ctrl = evt.target;

		if (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, &quot;.js-remove&quot;)) {  // Click on remove button
			item.parentNode.removeChild(item); // remove sortable item
		}
		else if (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, &quot;.js-edit&quot;)) {  // Click on edit link
			// ...
		}
	}
})
```


---


#### `ghostClass` option
Class name for the drop placeholder (default `sortable-ghost`).

Demo: http://jsbin.com/hunifu/4/edit?css,js,output

```css
.ghost {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

```js
Sortable.create(list, {
  ghostClass: &quot;ghost&quot;
});
```


---


#### `chosenClass` option
Class name for the chosen item  (default `sortable-chosen`).

Demo: http://jsbin.com/hunifu/3/edit?html,css,js,output

```css
.chosen {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #c00;
}
```

```js
Sortable.create(list, {
  delay: 500,
  chosenClass: &quot;chosen&quot;
});
```


---


#### `forceFallback` option
If set to `true`, the Fallback for non HTML5 Browser will be used, even if we are using an HTML5 Browser.
This gives us the possibility to test the behaviour for older Browsers even in newer Browser, or make the Drag 'n Drop feel more consistent between Desktop , Mobile and old Browsers.

On top of that, the Fallback always generates a copy of that DOM Element and appends the class `fallbackClass` defined in the options. This behaviour controls the look of this 'dragged' Element.

Demo: http://jsbin.com/yacuqib/edit?html,css,js,output


---


#### `fallbackTolerance` option
Emulates the native drag threshold. Specify in pixels how far the mouse should move before it's considered as a drag.
Useful if the items are also clickable like in a list of links.

When the user clicks inside a sortable element, it's not uncommon for your hand to move a little between the time you press and the time you release.  
Dragging only starts if you move the pointer past a certain tolerance, so that you don't accidentally start dragging every time you click.

3 to 5 are probably good values.


---


#### `scroll` option
If set to `true`, the page (or sortable-area) scrolls when coming to an edge.

Demo:
 - `window`: http://jsbin.com/tutuzeh/edit?html,js,output
 - `overflow: hidden`: http://jsbin.com/kolisu/edit?html,js,output


---


#### `scrollFn` option
Defines function that will be used for autoscrolling. el.scrollTop/el.scrollLeft is used by default.
Useful when you have custom scrollbar with dedicated scroll function.


---


#### `scrollSensitivity` option
Defines how near the mouse must be to an edge to start scrolling.


---


#### `scrollSpeed` option
The speed at which the window should scroll once the mouse pointer gets within the `scrollSensitivity` distance.


---


### Event object ([demo](http://jsbin.com/xedusu/edit?js,output))

 - to:`HTMLElement` — list, in which moved element.
 - from:`HTMLElement` — previous list
 - item:`HTMLElement` — dragged element
 - clone:`HTMLElement`
 - oldIndex:`Number|undefined` — old index within parent
 - newIndex:`Number|undefined` — new index within parent


#### `move` event object
 - to:`HTMLElement`
 - from:`HTMLElement`
 - dragged:`HTMLElement`
 - draggedRect:` TextRectangle`
 - related:`HTMLElement` — element on which have guided
 - relatedRect:` TextRectangle`


---


### Method


##### option(name:`String`[, value:`*`]):`*`
Get or set the option.



##### closest(el:`String`[, selector:`HTMLElement`]):`HTMLElement|null`
For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.


##### toArray():`String[]`
Serializes the sortable's item `data-id`'s (`dataIdAttr` option) into an array of string.


##### sort(order:`String[]`)
Sorts the elements according to the array.

```js
var order = sortable.toArray();
sortable.sort(order.reverse()); // apply
```


##### save()
Save the current sorting (see [store](#store))


##### destroy()
Removes the sortable functionality completely.


---


&lt;a name=&quot;store&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Store
Saving and restoring of the sort.

```html
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;order&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;save&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;restore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```js
Sortable.create(el, {
	group: &quot;localStorage-example&quot;,
	store: {
		/**
		 * Get the order of elements. Called once during initialization.
		 * @param   {Sortable}  sortable
		 * @returns {Array}
		 */
		get: function (sortable) {
			var order = localStorage.getItem(sortable.options.group.name);
			return order ? order.split('|') : [];
		},

		/**
		 * Save the order of elements. Called onEnd (when the item is dropped).
		 * @param {Sortable}  sortable
		 */
		set: function (sortable) {
			var order = sortable.toArray();
			localStorage.setItem(sortable.options.group.name, order.join('|'));
		}
	}
})
```

&lt;a name=&quot;cdn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### CDN

```html
&lt;!-- jsDelivr :: Sortable (http://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/sortablejs) --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sortablejs@1.6.1/Sortable.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;!-- jsDelivr :: Sortable :: Latest (http://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/sortablejs) --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sortablejs@latest/Sortable.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```


---


&lt;a name=&quot;jq&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### jQuery compatibility
To assemble plugin for jQuery, perform the following steps:

```bash
  cd Sortable
  npm install
  grunt jquery
```

Now you can use `jquery.fn.sortable.js`:&lt;br/&gt;
(or `jquery.fn.sortable.min.js` if you run `grunt jquery:min`)

```js
  $(&quot;#list&quot;).sortable({ /* options */ }); // init

  $(&quot;#list&quot;).sortable(&quot;widget&quot;); // get Sortable instance

  $(&quot;#list&quot;).sortable(&quot;destroy&quot;); // destroy Sortable instance

  $(&quot;#list&quot;).sortable(&quot;{method-name}&quot;); // call an instance method

  $(&quot;#list&quot;).sortable(&quot;{method-name}&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;); // call an instance method with parameters
```

And `grunt jquery:mySortableFunc` → `jquery.fn.mySortableFunc.js`

This is a library to generate and consume the source map format
[described here][format].

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works
in the following environments:

* Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an
  AMD loader such as RequireJS)

* Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)

* With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher

## Node

    $ npm install source-map

## Building from Source (for everywhere else)

Install Node and then run

    $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
    $ cd source-map
    $ npm link .

Next, run

    $ node Makefile.dryice.js

This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:

* `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.

* `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.

* `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.

## Examples

### Consuming a source map

```js
var rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: 'min.js',
  names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],
  sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],
  sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',
  mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA'
};

var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);

console.log(smc.sources);
// [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
//   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]

console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({
  line: 2,
  column: 28
}));
// { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
//   line: 2,
//   column: 10,
//   name: 'n' }

console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({
  source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
  line: 2,
  column: 10
}));
// { line: 2, column: 28 }

smc.eachMapping(function (m) {
  // ...
});
```

### Generating a source map

In depth guide:
[**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)

#### With SourceNode (high level API)

```js
function compile(ast) {
  switch (ast.type) {
  case 'BinaryExpression':
    return new SourceNode(
      ast.location.line,
      ast.location.column,
      ast.location.source,
      [compile(ast.left), &quot; + &quot;, compile(ast.right)]
    );
  case 'Literal':
    return new SourceNode(
      ast.location.line,
      ast.location.column,
      ast.location.source,
      String(ast.value)
    );
  // ...
  default:
    throw new Error(&quot;Bad AST&quot;);
  }
}

var ast = parse(&quot;40 + 2&quot;, &quot;add.js&quot;);
console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
  file: 'add.js'
}));
// { code: '40 + 2',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```

#### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)

```js
var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: &quot;source-mapped.js&quot;
});

map.addMapping({
  generated: {
    line: 10,
    column: 35
  },
  source: &quot;foo.js&quot;,
  original: {
    line: 33,
    column: 2
  },
  name: &quot;christopher&quot;
});

console.log(map.toString());
// '{&quot;version&quot;:3,&quot;file&quot;:&quot;source-mapped.js&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;foo.js&quot;],&quot;names&quot;:[&quot;christopher&quot;],&quot;mappings&quot;:&quot;;;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA&quot;}'
```

## API

Get a reference to the module:

```js
// NodeJS
var sourceMap = require('source-map');

// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;

// Inside Firefox
let sourceMap = {};
Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap);
```

### SourceMapConsumer

A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query
for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position
in the generated source.

#### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)

The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be
`JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
following attributes:

* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.

* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.

* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual
  mappings.

* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.

* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.

* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.

* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()

Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is
inclusive.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source.

* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest
  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,
  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not
  available.

* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is
  not available.

* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this
  information is not available.

* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)

Returns the generated line and column information for the original source,
line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

* `source`: The filename of the original source.

* `line`: The line number in the original source.

* `column`: The column number in the original source.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)

Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,
and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings
corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line
that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the
given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column
that has any offsets.

The only argument is an object with the following properties:

* `source`: The filename of the original source.

* `line`: The line number in the original source.

* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.

and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()

Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in
the source map, false otherwise.

In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`
will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])

Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only
argument is the URL of the original source file.

If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is
thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned
instead.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)

Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a
generated line/column in this source map.

* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the
  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,
  name }`

* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`
  every time that `callback` is called.

* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over
  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the
  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.

### SourceMapGenerator

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being
built incrementally.

#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])

You may pass an object with the following properties:

* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is
  associated with.

* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.

* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as
  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with
  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when
  running tests, if possible.

#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)

Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer

* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)

Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated
source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object
should have the following properties:

* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.

* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.

* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).

* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for an original source file.

* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.

* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])

Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.

* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.

* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.
  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
  Otherwise an error will be thrown.

* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.

  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
  relative to the SourceMap.

  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()

Renders the source map being generated to a string.

### SourceNode

SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.

#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])

* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
  it isn't associated with an original line.

* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null
  if it isn't associated with an original column.

* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.

* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see
  below.

* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.

#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])

Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.

* `code`: The generated code

* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code

* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`
  should be relative to.

#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)

Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)

Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.

* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file

* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file

#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)

Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking
function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and
the its original associated source's line/column location.

* `fn`: The traversal function.

#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)

Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each
source file content and is passed the filename and source content.

* `fn`: The traversal function.

#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)

Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator
between each of this source node's children.

* `sep`: The separator.

#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)

Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful
for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.

* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.

* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.

#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()

Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and
concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.

#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])

Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a
SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and
original sources.

The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)

Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.

To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-&lt;your new test name&gt;.js`
and export your test functions with names that start with &quot;test&quot;, for example

```js
exports[&quot;test doing the foo bar&quot;] = function (assert, util) {
  ...
};
```

The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.

The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.

The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have
access to the following assertion functions:

* `doesNotThrow`

* `equal`

* `ok`

* `strictEqual`

* `throws`

(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the
tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is
shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.

MIT licensed.

[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)

[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)

#### From the browser

Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
in your page, then call `stable()`.

 [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
 [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js

#### From Node.js

Install using NPM:

    npm install stable

Require in your code:

    var stable = require(&quot;stable&quot;);

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:

    stable([&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;]);   // =&gt; [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;]
    stable([10, 1, 5]);              // =&gt; [1, 10, 5]

Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:

    var arr = [10, 1, 5];
    stable(arr) === arr;            // =&gt; false
    stable.inplace(arr) === arr;    // =&gt; true

A comparator function can be specified:

    // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
    // This demonstrates the default behavior.
    function lexCmp(a, b) {
        return String(a).localeCompare(b);
    }
    stable([&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;], lexCmp);   // =&gt; [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;]

    // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
    // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
    function greaterThan(a, b) {
        return a &gt; b;
    }
    stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan);  // -&gt; [1, 5, 10]

=========
### Offers convenient getters and setters for the stat `mode`
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/stat-mode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/stat-mode)

You know that `mode` property on the `fs.Stat` object that you probably
usually just ignore? Well there's acutally a lot of information packed
into that number.

The specific information includes:

 * What the [&quot;file type&quot;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types) of file it is
 * Whether or not the [`setuid` and `setgid` bits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) are set
 * Whether or not the [`sticky` bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit) is set
 * The [_read_, _write_, and _execute_ permissions for the _owner_, _group_ and _others_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions)

This module helps you extract that information.

All the getters are also setters, which change the `mode` property
appropriately. This is useful for when you have to build up your
own `fs.Stat` object for whatever reason (like when implementing a
FUSE filesystem.


Installation
------------

``` bash
$ npm install stat-mode
```


Example
-------

So given some arbitrary file (let's say `/bin/echo`):

``` bash
$ ls -l /bin/echo
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 14128 Aug 11  2013 /bin/echo
```

We can inspect it using the `fs.stat()` call and creating a `Mode` instance
on top of it.

``` javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var Mode = require('stat-mode');

fs.stat('/bin/echo', function (err, stat) {
  if (err) throw err;

  // create a &quot;Mode&quot; instance on top of the `stat` object
  var mode = new Mode(stat);

  // you can check what kind of file it is:
  mode.isDirectory();
  // false

  mode.isFIFO();
  // false

  mode.isFile();
  // true


  // and you can also check individual owner, group and others permissions
  mode.owner.read;
  // true

  mode.owner.write;
  // true

  mode.owner.execute;
  // true

  mode.group.read;
  // true

  mode.group.write;
  // false

  mode.group.execute;
  // true

  mode.others.read;
  // true

  mode.others.write;
  // false

  mode.others.execute;
  // true


  // the `toString()` output resembes the `ls -l` output:
  mode.toString();
  // '-rwxr-xr-x'
});
```


API
---

### new Mode(Object stat) → Mode

You must pass in &quot;stat&quot; object to the `Mode` constructor. The &quot;stat&quot;
object can be a real `fs.Stat` instance, or really any Object with a
`mode` property.

#### mode.isDirectory([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;directory&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;directory&quot;.

#### mode.isFile([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;file&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;file&quot;.

#### mode.isBlockDevice([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;block device&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;block device&quot;.

#### mode.isCharacterDevice([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;character device&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;character
device&quot;.

#### mode.isSymbolicLink([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;symbolic link&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;symbolic link&quot;.

#### mode.isFIFO([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;FIFO&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;FIFO&quot;.

#### mode.isSocket([Boolean set]) → Boolean

Returns `true` if the mode's file type is &quot;socket&quot;, `false` otherwise.
If you pass `true` to the function, then the mode will be set to &quot;socket&quot;.

#### mode.owner.read → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;owner read&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.owner.write → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;owner write&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.owner.execute → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;owner execute&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.group.read → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;group read&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.group.write → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;group write&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.group.execute → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;group execute&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.others.read → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;others read&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.others.write → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;others write&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.

#### mode.others.execute → Boolean [Getter/Setter]

`true` if the mode is &quot;others execute&quot; rights, `false` otherwise.</pre></section></details><details><summary>static-extend@0.1.2</summary><section><h3>static-extend@0.1.2</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

A node module ensures a Readable stream continues flowing if it's not piped to
another destination.

	npm install stream-consume

## Usage

Simply pass a stream to `stream-consume`.
Both legacy streams and streams2 are supported.

``` js
var consume = require('stream-consume');

consume(readableStream);
```

## Details

Only Readable streams are processed (as determined by presence of `readable`
property and a `resume` property that is a function). If called with anything
else, it's a NOP.

For a streams2 stream (as determined by presence of a `_readableState`
property), nothing is done if the stream has already been piped to at least
one other destination.

`resume()` is used to cause the stream to continue flowing.

&gt; Strip UTF-8 [byte order mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8) (BOM) from a string/buffer/stream

From Wikipedia:

&gt; The Unicode Standard permits the BOM in UTF-8, but does not require nor recommend its use. Byte order has no meaning in UTF-8.


## Usage

```sh
$ npm install --save strip-bom
```

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var stripBom = require('strip-bom');

stripBom('\ufeffUnicorn');
//=&gt; Unicorn

stripBom(fs.readFileSync('unicorn.txt'));
//=&gt; Unicorn
```

Or as a [Transform stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform):

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var stripBom = require('strip-bom');

fs.createReadStream('unicorn.txt')
	.pipe(stripBom.stream())
	.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('unicorn.txt'));
```


## CLI

```sh
$ npm install --global strip-bom
```

```
$ strip-bom --help

  Usage
    strip-bom &lt;file&gt; &gt; &lt;new-file&gt;
    cat &lt;file&gt; | strip-bom &gt; &lt;new-file&gt;

  Example
    strip-bom unicorn.txt &gt; unicorn-without-bom.txt

``` javascript
var Tapable = require(&quot;tapable&quot;);
```

`Tapable` is a class for plugin binding and applying.

Just extend it.

``` javascript
function MyClass() {
	Tapable.call(this);
}

MyClass.prototype = Object.create(Tapable.prototype);

MyClass.prototype.method = function() {};
```

Or mix it in.

``` javascript
function MyClass2() {
	EventEmitter.call(this);
	Tapable.call(this);
}

MyClass2.prototype = Object.create(EventEmitter.prototype);
Tapable.mixin(MyClass2.prototype);

MyClass2.prototype.method = function() {};
```

## Public functions

### apply

``` javascript
void apply(plugins: Plugin...)
```

Attaches all plugins passed as arguments to the instance, by calling `apply` on them.

### plugin

``` javascript
void plugin(names: string|string[], handler: Function)
```

`names` are the names (or a single name) of the plugin interfaces the class provides.

`handler` is a callback function. The signature depends on the class. `this` is the instance of the class.

## Protected functions

### applyPlugins

``` javascript
void applyPlugins(name: string, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all args.

### applyPluginsWaterfall

``` javascript
any applyPluginsWaterfall(name: string, init: any, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with the return value of the previous handler and all args. For the first handler `init` is used and the return value of the last handler is return by `applyPluginsWaterfall`

### applyPluginsAsync

``` javascript
void applyPluginsAsync(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err?: Error) -&gt; void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -&gt; void`. The handler functions are called in order of registration.

`callback` is called after all handlers are called.

### applyPluginsBailResult

``` javascript
any applyPluginsBailResult(name: string, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler function are called with all args. If a handler function returns something `!== undefined`, the value is returned and no more handlers are applied.

### applyPluginsAsyncWaterfall

``` javascript
applyPluginsAsyncWaterfall(
	name: string,
	init: any,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -&gt; void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with the current value and a callback function with the signature `(err: Error, nextValue: any) -&gt; void`. When called, `nextValue` is the current value for the next handler. The current value for the first handler is `init`. After all handlers are applied, `callback` is called with the last value. If any handler passes a value for `err`, the `callback` is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

### applyPluginsAsyncSeries

``` javascript
applyPluginsAsyncSeries(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -&gt; void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all `args` and a callback function with the signature `(err: Error) -&gt; void`. The handlers are called in series, one at a time. After all handlers are applied, `callback` is called. If any handler passes a value for `err`, the `callback` is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

### applyPluginsParallel

``` javascript
applyPluginsParallel(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err?: Error) -&gt; void
)
```

Applies all registered handlers for `name` in parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -&gt; void`. The `callback` function is called when all handlers have called the callback without `err`. If any handler calls the callback with `err`, `callback` is invoked with this error and the other handlers are ignored.

### applyPluginsParallelBailResult

``` javascript
applyPluginsParallelBailResult(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -&gt; void
)
```

Applies all registered handlers for `name` in parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -&gt; void`. Handler functions must call the callback. They can either pass an error, pass undefined, or pass a value. The first result (either error or value) which is not undefined is passed to the `callback`. The order is defined by registration, not by the speed of the handler function.

### hasPlugins

``` js
hasPlugins(
	name: string
)
```

Returns true, if plugins are registered for this name.</pre></section></details><details><summary>tapable@1.0.0</summary><section><h3>tapable@1.0.0</h3><pre># Tapable

The tapable packages exposes many Hook classes, which can be used to create hooks for plugins.

``` javascript
const {
	SyncHook,
	SyncBailHook,
	SyncWaterfallHook,
	SyncLoopHook,
	AsyncParallelHook,
	AsyncParallelBailHook,
	AsyncSeriesHook,
	AsyncSeriesBailHook,
	AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook
 } = require(&quot;tapable&quot;);
```

## Usage

All Hook constructors take one optional argument, which is a list of argument names as strings.

``` js
const hook = new SyncHook([&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;, &quot;arg3&quot;]);
```

The best practice is to expose all hooks of a class in a `hooks` property:

``` js
class Car {
	constructor() {
		this.hooks = {
			accelerate: new SyncHook([&quot;newSpeed&quot;]),
			break: new SyncHook(),
			calculateRoutes: new AsyncParallelHook([&quot;source&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, &quot;routesList&quot;])
		};
	}

	/* ... */
}
```

Other people can now use these hooks:

``` js
const myCar = new Car();

// Use the tap method to add a consument
myCar.hooks.break.tap(&quot;WarningLampPlugin&quot;, () =&gt; warningLamp.on());
```

It's required to pass a name to identify the plugin/reason.

You may receive arguments:

``` js
myCar.hooks.accelerate.tap(&quot;LoggerPlugin&quot;, newSpeed =&gt; console.log(`Accelerating to ${newSpeed}`));
```

For sync hooks `tap` is the only valid method to add a plugin. Async hooks also support async plugins:

``` js
myCar.hooks.calculateRoutes.tapPromise(&quot;GoogleMapsPlugin&quot;, (source, target, routesList) =&gt; {
	// return a promise
	return google.maps.findRoute(source, target).then(route =&gt; {
		routesList.add(route);
	});
});
myCar.hooks.calculateRoutes.tapAsync(&quot;BingMapsPlugin&quot;, (source, target, routesList, callback) =&gt; {
	bing.findRoute(source, target, (err, route) =&gt; {
		if(err) return callback(err);
		routesList.add(route);
		// call the callback
		callback();
	});
});

// You can still use sync plugins
myCar.hooks.calculateRoutes.tap(&quot;CachedRoutesPlugin&quot;, (source, target, routesList) =&gt; {
	const cachedRoute = cache.get(source, target);
	if(cachedRoute)
		routesList.add(cachedRoute);
})
```

The class declaring these hooks need to call them:

``` js
class Car {
	/* ... */

	setSpeed(newSpeed) {
		this.hooks.accelerate.call(newSpeed);
	}

	useNavigationSystemPromise(source, target) {
		const routesList = new List();
		return this.hooks.calculateRoutes.promise(source, target, routesList).then(() =&gt; {
			return routesList.getRoutes();
		});
	}

	useNavigationSystemAsync(source, target, callback) {
		const routesList = new List();
		this.hooks.calculateRoutes.callAsync(source, target, routesList, err =&gt; {
			if(err) return callback(err);
			callback(null, routesList.getRoutes());
		});
	}
}
```

The Hook will compile a method with the most efficient way of running your plugins. It generates code depending on:
* The number of registered plugins (none, one, many)
* The kind of registered plugins (sync, async, promise)
* The used call method (sync, async, promise)
* The number of arguments
* Whether interception is used

This ensures fastest possible execution.

## Interception

All Hooks offer an additional interception API:

``` js
myCar.hooks.calculateRoutes.intercept({
	call: (source, target, routesList) =&gt; {
		console.log(&quot;Starting to calculate routes&quot;);
	},
	tap: (tapInfo) =&gt; {
		// tapInfo = { type: &quot;promise&quot;, name: &quot;GoogleMapsPlugin&quot;, fn: ... }
		console.log(`${tapInfo.name} is doing it's job`);
		return tapInfo; // may return a new tapInfo object
	}
})
```

**call**: `(...args) =&gt; void` Adding `call` to your interceptor will trigger when hooks are triggered. You have access to the hooks arguments.

**tap**: `(tap: Tap) =&gt; void` Adding `tap` to your interceptor will trigger when a plugin taps into a hook. Provided is the `Tap` object. `Tap` object can't be changed.

**loop**: `(...args) =&gt; void` Adding `loop` to your interceptor will trigger for each loop of a looping hook.

**register**: `(tap: Tap) =&gt; Tap | undefined` Adding `register` to your interceptor will trigger for each added `Tap` and allows to modify it.


## HookMap

A HookMap is a helper class for a Map with Hooks

``` js
const keyedHook = new HookMap(key =&gt; new SyncHook([&quot;arg&quot;]))
```

``` js
keyedHook.tap(&quot;some-key&quot;, &quot;MyPlugin&quot;, (arg) =&gt; { /* ... */ });
keyedHook.tapAsync(&quot;some-key&quot;, &quot;MyPlugin&quot;, (arg, callback) =&gt; { /* ... */ });
keyedHook.tapPromise(&quot;some-key&quot;, &quot;MyPlugin&quot;, (arg) =&gt; { /* ... */ });
```

``` js
const hook = keyedHook.get(&quot;some-key&quot;);
if(hook !== undefined) {
	hook.callAsync(&quot;arg&quot;, err =&gt; { /* ... */ });
}
```

## Hook/HookMap interface

Public:

``` ts
interface Hook {
	tap: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) =&gt; Result) =&gt; void,
	tapAsync: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args, callback: (err, result: Result) =&gt; void) =&gt; void) =&gt; void,
	tapPromise: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) =&gt; Promise&lt;Result&gt;) =&gt; void,
	intercept: (interceptor: HookInterceptor) =&gt; void
}

interface HookInterceptor {
	call: (context?, ...args) =&gt; void,
	loop: (context?, ...args) =&gt; void,
	tap: (context?, tap: Tap) =&gt; void,
	register: (tap: Tap) =&gt; Tap,
	context: boolean
}

interface HookMap {
	for: (key: any) =&gt; Hook,
	tap: (key: any, name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) =&gt; Result) =&gt; void,
	tapAsync: (key: any, name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args, callback: (err, result: Result) =&gt; void) =&gt; void) =&gt; void,
	tapPromise: (key: any, name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) =&gt; Promise&lt;Result&gt;) =&gt; void,
	intercept: (interceptor: HookMapInterceptor) =&gt; void
}

interface HookMapInterceptor {
	factory: (key: any, hook: Hook) =&gt; Hook
}

interface Tap {
	name: string,
	type: string
	fn: Function,
	stage: number,
	context: boolean
}
```

Protected (only for the class containing the hook):

``` ts
interface Hook {
	isUsed: () =&gt; boolean,
	call: (...args) =&gt; Result,
	promise: (...args) =&gt; Promise&lt;Result&gt;,
	callAsync: (...args, callback: (err, result: Result) =&gt; void) =&gt; void,
}

interface HookMap {
	get: (key: any) =&gt; Hook | undefined,
	for: (key: any) =&gt; Hook
}
```

## MultiHook

A helper Hook-like class to redirect taps to multiple other hooks:

``` js
const { MultiHook } = require(&quot;tapable&quot;);

this.hooks.allHooks = new MultiHook([this.hooks.hookA, this.hooks.hookB]);
```</pre></section></details><details><summary>tar-stream@1.5.5</summary><section><h3>tar-stream@1.5.5</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre></section></details><details><summary>through2-concurrent@1.1.1</summary><section><h3>through2-concurrent@1.1.1</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

===============

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/through2-filter.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/through2-filter/)

This is a super thin wrapper around [through2](http://npm.im/through2) that works like `Array.prototype.filter` but for streams.

For when through2 is just too verbose :wink:

Note you will **NOT** be able to alter the content of the chunks. This is intended for filtering only. If you want to modify the stream content, use either `through2` or `through2-map`.

```js
var filter = require(&quot;through2-filter&quot;)

var skip = filter(function (chunk) {
  // skip buffers longer than 100
  return chunk.length &lt; 100
})

// vs. with through2:
var skip = through2(function (chunk, encoding, callback) {
  // skip buffers longer than 100
  if (chunk.length &lt; 100) this.push(chunk)
  return callback()
})

// Then use your filter:
source.pipe(skip).pipe(sink)

// Additionally accepts `wantStrings` argument to conver buffers into strings
var alphanum = new RegExp(&quot;^[A-Za-z0-1]+$&quot;)
var scrub = filter({wantStrings: true}, function (str) {
  return alphanum.exec(str)
})

// Works like `Array.prototype.filter` meaning you can specify a function that
// takes up to two* arguments: fn(element, index)
var skip10 = filter(function (element, index) {
  return index &gt; 10
})
```

*Differences from `Array.prototype.filter`:
  * No third `array` callback argument. That would require realizing the entire stream, which is generally counter-productive to stream operations.
  * `Array.prototype.filter` doesn't modify the source Array, which is somewhat nonsensical when applied to streams.

API
---

`require(&quot;through2-filter&quot;)([options], fn)`
---

Create a `through2-filter` instance that will call `fn(chunk)`. If `fn(chunk)` returns &quot;true&quot; the chunk will be passed downstream. Otherwise it will be dropped.

`require(&quot;through2-filter&quot;).ctor([options], fn)`
---

Create a `through2-filter` Type that can be instantiated via `new Type()` or `Type()` to create reusable spies.

`require(&quot;through2-filter&quot;).obj([options], fn)`
---

Create a `through2-filter` that defaults to `objectMode = true`.

`require(&quot;through2-filter&quot;).objCtor([options], fn)`
---

Create a `through2-filter` Type that defaults to `objectMode = true`.

Options
-------

  * wantStrings: Automatically call chunk.toString() for the super lazy.
  * all other through2 options

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Tiny module wrapping try/catch in JavaScript. 

It's *literally 11 lines of code*, [just read it](tryit.js) that's all the documentation you'll need.


## install

```
npm install tryit
```

## usage 

What you'd normally do:
```js
try {
    dangerousThing();
} catch (e) {
    console.log('something');
}
```

With try-it (all it does is wrap try-catch)
```js
var tryit = require('tryit');

tryit(dangerousThing);
```

You can also handle the error by passing a second function
```js
tryit(dangerousThing, function (e) {
    if (e) {
        console.log('do something');
    }
})
```

The second function follows error-first pattern common in node. So if you pass a callback it gets called in both cases. But will have an error as the first argument if it fails.

## WHAT? WHY DO THIS!? 

Primary motivation is having a clean way to wrap things that might fail, where I don't care if it fails. I just want to try it. 

This includes stuff like blindly reading/parsing stuff from localStorage in the browser. If it's not there or if parsing it fails, that's fine. But I don't want to leave a bunch of empty `catch (e) {}` blocks in the code.

Obviously, this is useful any time you're going to attempt to read some unknown data structure.

In addition, my understanding is that it's hard for JS engines to optimize code in try blocks. By actually passing the code to be executed into a re-used try block, we can avoid having to have more than a single try block in our app. Again, this is not a primary motivation, just a potential side benefit.

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### A Unique Hexatridecimal ID generator. 
It will always create unique id's based on the current time, process and machine name.

```
npm install uniqid
```

## Usage
```js
var uniqid = require('uniqid');

console.log(uniqid()); // -&gt; 4n5pxq24kpiob12og9
console.log(uniqid(), uniqid()); // -&gt; 4n5pxq24kriob12ogd, 4n5pxq24ksiob12ogl
```

## Features
- Very fast
- Generates unique id's on multiple processes and machines even if called at the same time.
- Shorter 8 and 12 byte versions with less uniqueness.


# How it works
- With the current time the ID's are always unique in a single process.
- With the Process ID the ID's are unique even if called at the same time from multiple processes.
- With the MAC Address the ID's are unique even if called at the same time from multiple machines and processes.

## API:
####  **uniqid(** prefix *optional string* **)** 
Generate 18 byte unique id's based on the time, process id and mac address. Works on multiple processes and machines. 

```js
uniqid() -&gt; &quot;4n5pxq24kpiob12og9&quot;
uniqid('hello-') -&gt; &quot;hello-4n5pxq24kpiob12og9&quot;
```

####  **uniqid.process(** prefix *optional string* **)** 
Generate 12 byte unique id's based on the time and the process id. Works on multiple processes within a single machine but not on multiple machines.
```js
uniqid.process() -&gt; &quot;24ieiob0te82&quot;
```

####  **uniqid.time(** prefix *optional string* **)** 
Generate 8 byte unique id's based on the current time only. Recommended only on a single process on a single machine.

```js
uniqid.time() -&gt; &quot;iob0ucoj&quot;
```

## Webpack and Browserify
Since browsers don't provide a Process ID and in most cases neither give a Mac Address using uniqid from Webpack and Browserify falls back to `uniqid.time()` for all the other methods too. The browser is the single process, single machine case anyway.

## Debug
Debug messages are turned of by default as of `v4.1.0`. To turn on debug messages you'll need to set `uniqid_debug` to `true` before you require the module.

```js
// enable debug messages
module.uniqid_debug = true

// require the module
var uniqid = require('uniqid')
```

### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.

Example:

```js
var uniqs = require('uniqs');

var foo = { foo: 23 };
var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];

uniqs(list);
// =&gt; [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }]
```

You can pass multiple lists to create a union:

```js
uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]);
// =&gt; [2, 1, 3, 4]
```

Passing individual items works too:
```js
uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]);
// =&gt; [3, 2, 1]
```

### Summary

* Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality.
* The lists do not need to be sorted.
* The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.

### About

This package has been written to accompany utilities like
[flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown
libraries like underscore or lodash.

The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and
looks like this:

```js
module.exports = function uniqs() {
  var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);
  return list.filter(function(item, i) {
    return i == list.indexOf(item);
  });
};
```

===============

Generate a unique filename for use in temporary directories or caches.

```
var uniqueFilename = require('unique-filename')

// returns something like: /tmp/912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570
var randomTmpfile = uniqueFilename(os.tmpdir())

// returns something like: /tmp/my-test-912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570
var randomPrefixedTmpfile = uniqueFilename(os.tmpdir(), 'my-test')

var uniqueTmpfile = uniqueFilename('/tmp', 'testing', '/my/thing/to/uniq/on')
```

### uniqueFilename(*dir*, *fileprefix*, *uniqstr*) → String

Returns the full path of a unique filename that looks like:
`dir/prefix-7ddd44c0`
or `dir/7ddd44c0`

*dir* – The path you want the filename in. `os.tmpdir()` is a good choice for this.

*fileprefix* – A string to append prior to the unique part of the filename.
The parameter is required if *uniqstr* is also passed in but is otherwise
optional and can be `undefined`/`null`/`''`. If present and not empty
then this string plus a hyphen are prepended to the unique part.

*uniqstr* – Optional, if not passed the unique part of the resulting
filename will be random.  If passed in it will be generated from this string
in a reproducable way.</pre></section></details><details><summary>unique-slug@2.0.0</summary><section><h3>unique-slug@2.0.0</h3><pre>unique-slug
===========

Generate a unique character string suitible for use in files and URLs.

```
var uniqueSlug = require('unique-slug')

var randomSlug = uniqueSlug()
var fileSlug = uniqueSlug('/etc/passwd')
```

### uniqueSlug(*str*) → String (8 chars)

If *str* is passed in then the return value will be its murmur hash in
hex.

If *str* is not passed in, it will be 4 bytes coverted into 8 hex
characters, generated by `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes`.</pre></section></details><details><summary>unique-stream@1.0.0</summary><section><h3>unique-stream@1.0.0</h3><pre>Copyright 2014 Eugene Ware

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cainus/urlgrey.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cainus/urlgrey)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cainus/urlgrey/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/cainus/urlgrey)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/urlgrey.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/urlgrey)

[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/cainus/urlgrey.png)](http://ci.testling.com/cainus/urlgrey)

Urlgrey is a library for url manipulation.  It's got a chainable/fluent interface
that makes a number of methods available for querying different aspects of a url, 
and even modifying it to create new urls.

Most methods are named after different parts of the url and allow you to read that part from the 
current url if you don't pass any parameters, or they allow you to generate a new url with a 
change to that part in the current url if you do pass a parameter.

For the examples below, we'll use the following url:
```
https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid?asdf=1234#frag
```

To create a new urlgrey object, just pass a url to urlgrey like so:
```javascript
var url = urlgrey(&quot;https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid?asdf=1234#frag&quot;)
```

##API specifics:

###url.child([lastPart])

Setter/getter for the last part of a path:
```javascript
  url.child(); // returns &quot;kid&quot; 
  url.child(&quot;grandkid&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri 
                             // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/grandkid?asdf=1234#frag
```   
###url.decode(encodedString);
Returns the decoded version of the input string using node's standard querystring.unescape().
```javascript
      url.decode('this%20is%20a%20test');  // returns &quot;this is a test&quot;
```   
    
###url.encode(unencodedString);
Returns the encoded version of the input string using node's standard querystring.escape().
```javascript
      url.encode('this is a test'); // returns 'this%20is%20a%20test'
```   
    
###url.hash([newHash])
Setter/getter for the url fragment/anchor/hash of a path.
```javascript
      url.hash(); // returns 'frag'
      url.hash(&quot;blah&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                            // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#blah
```   
###url.hostname([newHostname])
Setter/getter for the url hostname.
```javascript
      url.hostname(); // returns 'subdomain.asdf.com'
      url.hostname(&quot;geocities.com&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                            // https://user:pass@geocities.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag
```   
###url.parent();
Get the parent URI of the current URI. (This property is read-only).
```javascript
      url.parent();  // returns a new uri object with the uri
                     // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/
```   

###url.password([newPassword]);
Setter/getter for the password portion of the url.
```javascript
      url.password(); // returns 'pass'
      url.password(&quot;newpass&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                            // https://user:newpass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag
```   
###url.extendedPath([string]);
Setter/getter for the path, querystring and fragment portion of the url
all at once.
```javascript
      url.extendedPath(); // returns '/path/kid?asdf=1234#frag'
      url.extendedPath(&quot;/newpath?new=query#newfrag&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                               // https://user:newpass@subdomain.asdf.com/newpath?new=query#newfrag

```   

###url.path([mixed]);
Setter/getter for the path portion of the url.
```javascript
      url.path(); // returns '/path/kid'
      url.path(&quot;newpath&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                               // https://user:newpass@subdomain.asdf.com/newpath

      // ALSO, .path() can take arrays of strings as input as well:
      url.path(['qwer', '/asdf'], 'qwer/1234/', '/1234/'); 
                      // this returns a new uri object with the uri
                      // https://user:newpass@subdomain.asdf.com/qwer/asdf/qwer/1234/1234
```   
    
Note: changing the path will remove the querystring and hash, since they rarely make sense on a new path.

###url.port([newPort]);
Setter/getter for the port portion of the url.
```javascript
      url.port(); // returns 80
      url.port(8080); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                          // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com:8080/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag
```   


###url.protocol([newProtocol]);


Setter/getter for the protocol portion of the url.
```javascript
      url.protocol(); // returns 'https'
      url.protocol(&quot;http&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the uri
                                // http://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag
```   

###url.query([mixed]);

Setter/getter for the querystring using javascript objects.
```javascript
      url.query(); // returns {asdf : 1234}
      url.query(false); // returns a new uri object with the querystring-free uri
                            // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid#frag
      url.query({spaced : 'space test'})
                                // returns a new uri object with the input object serialized
                                // and merged into the querystring like so:
                                // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234&amp;spaced=space%20test#frag
```   
    
NOTE: escaping and unescaping of applicable characters happens automatically. (eg &quot; &quot; to &quot;%20&quot;, and vice versa)

NOTE: an input object will overwrite an existing querystring where they have the same names.

NOTE: an input object will remove an existing name-value pair where they have the same names and the value in the input name-value pair is null.


###url.queryString([newQueryString]);

Setter/getter for the querystring using a plain string representation. This is lower-level than .query(), but allows complete control of the querystring.
```javascript
      url.queryString(); // returns asdf=1234  (notice there is no leading '?')
      url.queryString(&quot;blah&quot;); // returns a new uri object with a new querystring
                               // https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid?blah#frag
```   
    
NOTE: no escaping/unescaping of applicable characters will occur. This must be done manually.

###url.rawChild();

This method is the same as url.child() but does not automatically url-encode
any part of the input.

###url.rawPath();
This method is the same as url.path() but does not automatically url-encode
any part of the path.

###url.rawQuery();
This method is the same as url.query() but does not automatically url-encode
any of the keys or values in an input object.


###url.toJson();
Returns the json representation of the uri object, which is simply the uri as a string. The output is exactly the same as .toString(). This method is read-only.
```javascript
  url.toJson(); // returns &quot;https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag&quot;
```   

###url.toString();
Returns the string representation of the uri object, which is simply the uri as a string. This method is read-only.
```javascript
      url.toString(); // returns &quot;https://user:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag&quot;
```   

###url.username([newUsername])
Setter/getter for the username portion of the url.
```javascript
      url.username(); // returns 'user'
      url.username(&quot;newuser&quot;); // returns a new uri object with the 
                               // uri https://newuser:pass@subdomain.asdf.com/path/kid/?asdf=1234#frag
```

##Installation:
### node.js:
`npm install urlgrey --save`

Also!  If you're using urlgrey in an http application, see [urlgrey-connect](https://github.com/cainus/urlgrey-connect).  It gives you an urlgrey object already instantiated with the request url as req.uri in all your request handlers.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache)

`v8-compile-cache` attaches a `require` hook to use [V8's code cache](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html) to speed up instantiation time. The &quot;code cache&quot; is the work of parsing and compiling done by V8.

The ability to tap into V8 to produce/consume this cache was introduced in [Node v5.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.7.0/).

## Usage

1. Add the dependency:

  ```sh
  $ npm install --save v8-compile-cache
  ```

2. Then, in your entry module add:

  ```js
  require('v8-compile-cache');
  ```

**Requiring `v8-compile-cache` in Node &lt;5.7.0 is a noop – but you need at least Node 4.0.0 to support the ES2015 syntax used by `v8-compile-cache`.**

## Options

Set the environment variable `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` to disable the cache.

## Internals

The caches are stored in `$TMP/v8-compile-cache/V8_VERSION`, where there are `.BLOB` and `.MAP` files corresponding to the entry module that required `v8-compile-cache`. The cache is _entry module specific_ because it is faster to load the entire code cache into memory at once, than it is to read it from disk on a file-by-file basis.

## Benchmarks

See https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache/tree/master/bench.

**Load Times:**

| Module           | Without Cache | With Cache |
| ---------------- | -------------:| ----------:|
| `babel-core`     | `218ms`       | `185ms`    |
| `yarn`           | `153ms`       | `113ms`    |
| `yarn` (bundled) | `228ms`       | `105ms`    |

_^ Includes the overhead of loading the cache itself._

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Apply a source map to a vinyl file, merging it with preexisting source maps.

## Usage:

```javascript
var applySourceMap = require('vinyl-sourcemaps-apply');
applySourceMap(vinylFile, sourceMap);
```

### Example (Gulp plugin):

```javascript
var through = require('through2');
var applySourceMap = require('vinyl-sourcemaps-apply');
var myTransform = require('myTransform');

module.exports = function(options) {

  function transform(file, encoding, callback) {
    // generate source maps if plugin source-map present
    if (file.sourceMap) {
      options.makeSourceMaps = true;
    }

    // do normal plugin logic
    var result = myTransform(file.contents, options);
    file.contents = new Buffer(result.code);

    // apply source map to the chain
    if (file.sourceMap) {
      applySourceMap(file, result.map);
    }

    this.push(file);
    callback();
  }

  return through.obj(transform);
};
```</pre></section></details><details><summary>vinyl@0.4.6</summary><section><h3>vinyl@0.4.6</h3><pre>Copyright (c) 2013 Fractal &lt;contact@wearefractal.com&gt;

&gt; This package is auto-generated. For pull requests please see [src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js).

This package can be used to pre-compile Vue 2.0 templates into render functions to avoid runtime-compilation overhead and CSP restrictions. You will only need it if you are writing build tools with very specific needs. In most cases you should be using [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) or [`vueify`](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify) instead, both of which use this package internally.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install vue-template-compiler
```

``` js
const compiler = require('vue-template-compiler')
```

## API

### compiler.compile(template, [options])

Compiles a template string and returns compiled JavaScript code. The returned result is an object of the following format:

``` js
{
  ast: ?ASTElement, // parsed template elements to AST
  render: string, // main render function code
  staticRenderFns: Array&lt;string&gt;, // render code for static sub trees, if any
  errors: Array&lt;string&gt; // template syntax errors, if any
}
```

Note the returned function code uses `with` and thus cannot be used in strict mode code.

#### Options

It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-loader` and `vueify`.**

The optional `options` object can contain the following:

- `modules`

  An array of compiler modules. For details on compiler modules, refer to the `ModuleOptions` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js#L38-L45) and the [built-in modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules).

- `directives`

  An object where the key is the directive name and the value is a function that transforms an template AST node. For example:

  ``` js
  compiler.compile('&lt;div v-test&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', {
    directives: {
      test (node, directiveMeta) {
        // transform node based on directiveMeta
      }
    }
  })
  ```

  By default, a compile-time directive will extract the directive and the directive will not be present at runtime. If you want the directive to also be handled by a runtime definition, return `true` in the transform function.

  Refer to the implementation of some [built-in compile-time directives](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/directives).

- `preserveWhitespace`

  Defaults to `true`. This means the compiled render function preserves all whitespace characters between HTML tags. If set to `false`, whitespace between tags will be ignored. This can result in slightly better performance but may affect layout for inline elements.

---

### compiler.compileToFunctions(template)

Similar to `compiler.compile`, but directly returns instantiated functions:

``` js
{
  render: Function,
  staticRenderFns: Array&lt;Function&gt;
}
```

This is only useful at runtime with pre-configured builds, so it doesn't accept any compile-time options. In addition, this method uses `new Function()` so it is not CSP-compliant.

---

### compiler.ssrCompile(template, [options])

&gt; 2.4.0+

Same as `compiler.compile` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.

This is used by default in `vue-loader@&gt;=12` and can be disabled using the [`optimizeSSR`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#optimizessr) option.

---

### compiler.ssrCompileToFunctions(template)

&gt; 2.4.0+

Same as `compiler.compileToFunction` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.

---

### compiler.parseComponent(file, [options])

Parse a SFC (single-file component, or `*.vue` file) into a descriptor (refer to the `SFCDescriptor` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js)). This is used in SFC build tools like `vue-loader` and `vueify`.

#### Options

#### `pad`

`pad` is useful when you are piping the extracted content into other pre-processors, as you will get correct line numbers or character indices if there are any syntax errors.

- with `{ pad: &quot;line&quot; }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one newline for each line in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the line numbers align with the original file.
- with `{ pad: &quot;space&quot; }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one space for each character in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the character count remains the same as the original file.</pre></section></details><details><summary>vue-template-es2015-compiler@1.6.0</summary><section><h3>vue-template-es2015-compiler@1.6.0</h3><pre>This is an internal package used by `vue-loader` and `vueify`. It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:

1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).

2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.

The buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble</pre></section></details><details><summary>vue@2.5.13</summary><section><h3>vue@2.5.13</h3><pre>The MIT License (MIT)

  Easily create your own middleware layer.

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/segmentio/ware.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/segmentio/ware)

## Installation

Node:

```bash
$ npm install ware
```

Component:

```bash
$ component install segmentio/ware
```

Duo:

```js
var ware = require('segmentio/ware');
```

## Example

```js
var ware = require('ware');
var middleware = ware()
  .use(function (req, res, next) {
    res.x = 'hello';
    next();
  })
  .use(function (req, res, next) {
    res.y = 'world';
    next();
  });

middleware.run({}, {}, function (err, req, res) {
  res.x; // &quot;hello&quot;
  res.y; // &quot;world&quot;
});
```

  Give it any number of arguments:

```js
var ware = require('ware');
var middleware = ware()
  .use(function (a, b, c, next) {
    console.log(a, b, c);
    next();
  })

middleware.run(1, 2, 3); // 1, 2, 3
```

  Supports generators (on the server):

```js
var ware = require('ware');
var middleware = ware()
  .use(function (obj) {
    obj.url = 'http://google.com';
  })
  .use(function *(obj) {
    obj.src = yield http.get(obj.url);
  })

middleware.run({ url: 'http://facebook.com' }, function(err, obj) {
  if (err) throw err;
  obj.src // &quot;obj.url&quot; source
});
```

## API

#### ware()

  Create a new list of middleware.

#### .use(fn)

  Push a middleware `fn` onto the list. `fn` can be a synchronous, asynchronous, or generator function.
  `fn` can also be an array of functions or an instance of `Ware`.

#### .run(input..., [callback])

  Runs the middleware functions with `input...` and optionally calls `callback(err, input...)`.

       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

made out of meat
----------------

meat.js

    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(15);
    console.log(wrap('You and your whole family are made out of meat.'));

output:

    You and your
    whole family
    are made out
    of meat.

output:

                        At long last the struggle and tumult
                        was over. The machines had finally cast

                        Just drifting through emptiness. The
                        sun was just another point of light.

methods
=======

var wrap = require('wordwrap');

wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params={mode:&quot;soft&quot;})
---------------------------------------------------

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.

In &quot;soft&quot; mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in &quot;hard&quot; mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.

wrap.hard(start, stop)
----------------------

Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = &quot;hard&quot;`.</pre></section></details><details><summary>wordwrap@1.0.0</summary><section><h3>wordwrap@1.0.0</h3><pre>This software is released under the MIT license:

&gt; Handles the lifecycle and bootstrapping of generators in a specific environment

It provides a high-level API to discover, create and run generators, as well as further tuning of where and how a generator is resolved.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save yeoman-environment
```


## Usage

Full documentation available at http://yeoman.io/authoring/integrating-yeoman.html

```js
var yeoman = require('yeoman-environment');
var env = yeoman.createEnv();

// The #lookup() method will search the user computer for installed generators.
// The search if done from the current working directory.
env.lookup(function () {
  env.run('angular', {'skip-install': true}, function (err) {
    console.log('done');
  });
});
```

For advance usage, see [our API documentation](http://yeoman.github.io/environment).
